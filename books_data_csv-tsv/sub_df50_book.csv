Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes,the first sally alonso quijano the protagonist of the novel is a retired country gentleman nearing fifty years of age living in an unnamed section of la mancha with his niece and housekeeper while mostly a rational man of sound reason his reading of books of chivalry in excess has had a profound effect on him leading to the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties in essence he believes every word of these books of chivalry to be true though for the most part the content of these books is clearly fiction otherwise his wits in regards to everything other than chivalry are intact he decides to go out as a knight errant in search of adventure he dons an old suit of armour renames himself don quixote de la mancha and names his skinny horse rocinante he designates a neighboring farm girl as his lady love renaming her dulcinea del toboso while she knows nothing about this he sets out in the early morning and ends up at an inn which he believes to be a castle he asks the innkeeper whom he thinks to be the lord of the castle to dub him a knight he spends the night holding vigil over his armor where he becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules the innkeeper then dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way don quixote next frees a young boy who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master by making his master swear on the chivalric code to treat the boy fairly the boys beating is continued as soon as quixote leaves don quixote has a run in with traders from toledo who insult the imaginary dulcinea one of whom severely beats don quixote and leaves him on the side of the road don quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant the second sally while don quixote is unconscious in his bed his niece the housekeeper the parish curate and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off after a short period of feigning health don quixote approaches his neighbor sancho panza and asks him to be his squire promising him governorship of an island the uneducated sancho agrees and the pair sneak off in the early dawn it is here that their series of famous adventures begin starting with don quixotes attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants the two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage they are heavily cloaked as is the lady to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road don quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive he knocks a friar from his horse and is immediately challenged by an armed basque traveling with the company as he has no shield the basque uses a pillow to protect himself which saves him when don quixote strikes him the combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and demanding those traveling with her to surrender to don quixote the pastoral wanderings sancho and don quixote go on and fall in with a group of goatherds don quixote tells sancho and the goatherds about the golden age of man reminiscent of both ovid and the later rousseau in which property does not exist and men live in peace the goatherds invite the knight and sancho to the funeral of gris stomo once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels seeking the shepherdess marcela at the funeral marcela appears delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by gris stomo claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich s she disappears into the woods and don quixote and sancho follow ultimately giving up the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest some galicians arrive to water their ponies and rocinante don quixotes horse attempts to mate with the ponies the galicians hit rocinante with clubs to dissuade him which don quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend rocinante the galicians beat don quixote and sancho leaving them in great pain the adventures with cardenio and dorotea after don quixote frees a group of galley slaves the knight and sancho wander into the sierra morena and there encounter the dejected cardenio cardenio relates the first part of his story in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend luscinda and is hired as the companion to the dukes son leading to his friendship with the dukes younger son don fernando cardenio confides in don fernando his love for luscinda and the delays in their engagement caused by cardenios desire to keep with tradition after reading cardenios poems praising luscinda don fernando falls in love with her don quixote interrupts when cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels in the course of their travels the protagonists meet innkeepers prostitutes goatherds soldiers priests escaped convicts and scorned lovers these encounters are magnified by don quixote s imagination into chivalrous quests don quixote s tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him and his habit of not paying his debts result in many privations injuries and humiliations with sancho often getting the worst of it finally don quixote is persuaded to return to his home village the author hints that there was a third quest but says that records of it have been lost the third sally although the two parts are now normally published as a single work don quixote part two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel while part one was mostly farcical the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception as part two begins it is assumed that the literate classes of spain have all read the first part of the history of don quixote and his squire cervantess meta fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of part one as well as with an actually published fraudulent part two when strangers encounter the duo in person they already know their famous history a duke and duchess and others deceive don quixote for entertainment setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes some of them are quite sadistic and they put don quixotes sense of chivalry and his devotion to dulcinea through many tests even sancho deceives him at one point pressured into finding dulcinea sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls and tells don quixote that they are dulcinea and her ladies in waiting when don quixote only sees the peasant girls sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when as part of one of the duke and duchesss pranks the two are led to believe that the only method to release dulcinea from her spell is for sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes sancho naturally resists this course of action leading to friction with his master under the dukes patronage sancho eventually gets a governorship though it is false and proves to be a wise and practical ruler though this ends in humiliation as well near the end don quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity an inn is just an inn not a castle the lengthy untold history of don quixotes adventures in knight errantry comes to a close after his battle with the knight of the white moon in which we the readers find him conquered bound by the rules of chivalry don quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror which in this case is that don quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year a duration in which he may be cured of his madness defeated and dejected he and sancho start their journey home part two of don quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about this is a theme much explored in writings of the th century upon returning to his village don quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd although his housekeeper who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs soon after he retires to his bed with a deathly illness possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations one day he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity sancho tries to restore his faith but alonso quixano for that is his true name can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused he dictates his will which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry after alonso quixano dies the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about don quixote would be spurious
Dune Messiah,Frank Herbert,twelve years after the events described in dune paul muaddib atreides rules as emperor by accepting the role of messiah to the fremen paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe while paul is the most powerful emperor ever known he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created although sixty one billion people have perished pauls prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity motivated by this knowledge paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the fremen religion the bene gesserit spacing guild and tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone paul the bene gesserit reverend mother gaius helen mohiam enlisting pauls own consort princess irulan daughter of the deposed padishah emperor shaddam corrino iv paul has refused to father a child with irulan or even touch her but his fremen concubine chani has also failed to produce an heir causing tension within his monarchy desperate both to secure her place in the atreides dynasty and to preserve the atreides bloodline for the bene gesserit breeding program irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to chani paul is aware of this fact but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring chanis death and does not want to lose her because of the way oracles interfere with one anothers prescience the guild navigator edric is able to shield the conspiracy from pauls visions of the future the tleilaxu face dancer scytale gives paul a gift he cannot resist a tleilaxu grown ghola of the deceased duncan idaho pauls childhood teacher and friend now called hayt the conspirators hope the presence of hayt will undermine pauls ability to rule by forcing paul to question himself and the empire he has created furthermore pauls acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the fremen who see the tleilaxu and their tools as unclean chani taking matters into her own hands switches to a traditional fremen fertility diet preventing irulan from being able to tamper with her food and soon becomes pregnant otheym one of pauls former fedaykin death commandos reveals evidence of a fremen conspiracy against paul otheym gives paul his dwarf tleilaxu servant bijaz who like a recording machine can remember faces names and details paul accepts reluctantly seeing the strands of a tleilaxu plot as pauls soldiers attack the conspirators others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner purchased from the tleilaxu that destroys the area and blinds paul by tradition all blind fremen are abandoned in the desert but paul shocks the fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see even without eyes his oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens as though his eyes still function by moving through his life in lockstep with his visions he can see even the slightest details of the world around him the disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted the unraveling of the fremen conspiracy reveals that korba a former fedaykin and now high priest of pauls church is among pauls enemies hayt interrogates bijaz but the little man actually an agent of the tleilaxu uses a specific humming intonation that renders hayt open to implanted commands bijaz programs hayt to offer paul a bargain when chani dies chanis rebirth as a ghola and the hope that duncan idahos memories might be reawakened in return for paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force hayt to attempt to kill paul given the appropriate circumstances hayt remains oblivious of the programming eventually news is brought that chani has died giving birth pauls reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of hayt who attempts to kill paul but rather than kill his beloved paul duncans ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers duncans full consciousness he remains conscious of the zen sunni and mentat training given to hayt by the tleilaxu but is no longer bound to their programming paul and chanis newborn twins are pre born like pauls sister alia had been and come into the world fully conscious with kwisatz haderach like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in chanis special pregnancy diet scytale offers to revive chani as a ghola in return for all of pauls choam holdings paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the tleilaxu might program chani in some diabolical way and scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with alia paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son yet he is able to kill scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his sons perspective now prophetically as well as physically blind paul chooses to embrace the fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert winning the fealty of the fremen for his children who will inherit his mantle of emperor paul leaves alia now romantically involved with duncan as regent for the twins whom he has named leto and ghanima duncan notes the irony that paul and chanis deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies and that paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man while

Darwin's Dangerous Idea,Daniel Dennett,starting in the middle part i of darwins dangerous idea gets its name from a quote by willard van orman quine analyze theory building how we will we all must start in the middle our conceptual firsts are middle sized middle distance objects and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race the first chapter tell me why is named after a song before charles darwin god was seen as the ultimate cause of all design or the ultimate answer to why questions john locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter and david hume while exposing problems with lockes view could not see any alternative darwin provided just such an alternative evolution besides providing evidence of common descent he introduced a mechanism to explain it natural selection according to dennett natural selection is a mindless mechanical and algorithmic process mdash darwins dangerous idea the third chapter introduces the concept of skyhooks and cranes see below he suggests that resistance to darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks which do not really exist according to dennett good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes chapter looks at the tree of life such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in lifes history the next chapter concerns the possible and the actual using the library of mendel the space of all logically possible genomes as a conceptual aid in the last chapter of part i dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified design space descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently however there are also forced moves or good tricks that will be discovered repeatedly either by natural selection see convergent evolution or human investigation the first chapter of part ii darwinian thinking in biology asserts that life originated without any skyhooks and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos the eighth chapters message is conveyed by its title biology is engineering biology is the study of design function construction and operation however there are some important differences between biology and engineering related to the engineering concept of optimization the next chapter deals with adaptationism which dennett endorses calling gould and lewontins refutation of it an illusion dennett thinks adaptationism is in fact the best way of uncovering constraints the tenth chapter entitled bully for brontosaurus is an extended critique of stephen jay gould who dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings his self styled revolutions against adaptationism gradualism and other orthodox darwinism all being false alarms the final chapter of part ii dismisses directed mutation the inheritance of acquired traits and teilhards omega point and insists that other controversies and hypotheses like the unit of selection and panspermia have no dire consequences for orthodox darwinism mind meaning mathematics and morality is the name of part iii which begins with a quote from nietzsche chapter the cranes of culture discusses cultural evolution it asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture and that it allows humans alone among animals to transcend our selfish genes losing our minds to darwin follows a chapter about the evolution of brains minds and language dennett criticizes noam chomskys perceived resistance to the evolution of language its modeling by artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the evolution of meaning is then discussed and dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless algorithmic processes chapter asserts that g dels theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible dennett extends his criticism to roger penrose the subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality beginning with thomas hobbes who dennett calls the first sociobiologist and friedrich nietzsche he concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense though he cautions against some varieties of greedy ethical reductionism before moving to the next chapter he discusses some sociobiology controversies the penultimate chapter entitled redesigning morality begins by asking if ethics can be naturalized dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems in the future of an idea the books last chapter dennett praises biodiversity including cultural diversity in closing he uses beauty and the beast as an analogy although darwins idea may seem dangerous it is actually quite beautiful

montag finds mildred in the kitchen making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed but is interrupted by mildreds ramblings of her stomach hurting but being hungry and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party as montag leaves for work he finally tells mildred who is watching an interactive soap opera

when the train comes to take him to work a few days later the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books the firemen go to arrest her but instead the

accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see the woman is given a final warning to leave the house but the woman produces a match before she can strike it the firemen flee save for montag who watches as the woman lights the match drops it in the kerosene and is engulfed in flames montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half asleep mildred where the two first met and when mildred tries to remember but cant laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills as montag reflects on his stagnant stilted marriage to mildred and how mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her parlor wall entertainment driving recklessly and her sleeping pill addiction montag begins to cry after realizing that if mildred died he wouldnt miss her at all montag then asks mildred about clarisse and her whereabouts mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to clarisse then tells montag exactly what happened to her clarisse was run over by a speeding car and once her family heard the news about her death they packed up and moved away all of

wakes up physically ill and begs mildred to call in sick for him mildred refuses and doesnt believe that montag is really sick even when montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene which earlier was like a perfume to him mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash captain beatty montags fire chief personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in over the course of several decades with the starting point being after the american civil war populations grew and people embraced new media sports and a quickening pace of life books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span later minorities and other special interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend books became blander and blander due to censorship measures and eventually books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile the only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics three dimensional sex magazines trade magazines and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls to get rid of the books from the past and their copies the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire resistant and placate the masses as beatty is giving his monologue mildred tries to fluff montags pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath montag yells at her and mildred at the request of beatty quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls beatty knows that montag has a book but acts casual about it stating that its natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one if the book isnt burned or returned to the firehouse

the stolen books and nearly getting caught by the firehouses mechanical hound mildred argues with montag that books have no meaning and questions why montag dragged her into this montag snaps back by mentioning mildreds overdose clarisses death the book woman who burned herself and how society is falling apart due to apathy ignorance and a pending war then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction before montag can finish mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch the white clown on the parlor walls montag laments that his wife is a lost cause and he will be too if he cant force himself to absorb the information in the books montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago faber a former english professor montag seeks fabers help though faber refuses at first due to his cowardice after montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of the new testament one of the few left that actually contains gods word rather than the bastardized versions that have jesus and other biblical characters shilling products faber relents and teaches montag about the importance of literature in its attempt to explain human existence he gives montag an ear piece communicator he made himself so that faber can offer guidance throughout his daily activities at montags house mildred has friends mrs phelps and mrs bowles over to watch the parlor walls in the middle of a bloody demolition derby montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war death their families and politics montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them despite fabers warnings mildred tries to cover up montags actions by claiming that once a year firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem dover beach on it and assures that none of her friends will understand any of the words a shaken confused montag reads the poem which ends up making mrs phelps cry mrs bowles however is disgusted accuses montag of being nasty and breaks off her friendship with mildred montag yells at the women to go home and reflect on their empty lives and burns the poetry book while mildred locks herself in the bathroom to take her pills montag returns to the firehouse the next day with only one of the books which beatty tosses into the trash beatty tells montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other in describing the dream beatty shows that despite his disillusionment he was once an enthusiastic reader a fire alarm goes off and

God Emperor of Dune,Frank Herbert,the seemingly immortal god emperor leto ii has ruled his empire for more than years his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in children of dune to merge his human body with sandtrout the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of arrakis his continued evolution has slowly transformed him altering his human form into what he calls a pre worm his body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of arrakis mdash ribbed elongated and covered in scaly sandtrout his face remains as do his hands and arms but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of ixian manufacture it is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form this distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm even allowing him to survive lasgun fire but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water during his long reign leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire both through tight control of his enormous but limited hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his fish speaker army the old imperium is basically non existent the landsraad has ceased to exist and only a few remnants of the great houses survive the bene gesserit and spacing guild have endured although both have been forced to adapt to letos absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience and choam has been reduced to a shadow of its former self his reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race letos enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life close to absolute prescience a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths as decades may pass without him realizing it few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the golden path the end justifying the means leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government and as god he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept as his father before him leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive mdash and thus control mdash is connected to his eventual death ironically this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of duncan idaho the faithful swordmaster of house atreides duncan functions both as the captain of letos guard and as a familiar face to calm leto in his moments of distress they remind leto of his family and he feels that he owes duncan for his service and devotion to house atreides the vast majority of these gholas are made under letos instructions of preserving the original idaho without enhancements idahos masterful abilities thus are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by letos servants over the centuries a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to house atreides and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation leto has forced upon the empire these feelings compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time drives some of the duncan idaho gholas insane even when he doesnt ask for a new ghola or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous idahos demise the tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival letos golden path as he calls it is a millennia spanning attempt to produce a human who is invisible to a watcher gifted with prescience this breeding plan begun with the marriage of letos twin sister ghanima to faradn corrino has resulted in letos majordomo moneo atreides and his daughter siona moneo has served leto faithfully for the majority of his life having been a rebel until he was shown the golden path in a test by leto siona is the leader of a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the god emperor and locate his hidden hoard of melange unbeknownst to siona nayla mdash her close friend and de facto bodyguard mdash worships leto and is under orders to protect and obey siona in all things while reporting on her rebellious activities although leto knows the important purpose of siona as long as she doesnt serve the golden path she would be expendable and he would have to take measures for the breeding paths that he would have to take to replace her during a raid on his citadel siona and her friends steal among other things a series of excerpts from letos private journal unknown to them leto is aware of their activities and allows them to continue in perusing some of the items and documents stolen from the citadel siona learns that leto remains capable of love and plots to use this as a weapon against him at the same time the new ixian ambassador hwi noree is sent to the court of the god emperor immediately entranced by her beauty grace and purity leto begins to be tortured by the knowledge that he and hwi are separated by his continued transformation for her part hwi desires nothing more than to serve the god emperor and she quickly becomes a confidante finally expressing her love of leto the latest incarnation of duncan is also captivated by hwis beauty but is rebuffed by leto who warns that hwi is his alone because of his intense feelings for hwi and the fact that she had never appeared in his prescient visions leto realizes that she is a trap trained and sent by the ixians to weaken him however he is unable to send her away and she gladly accepts his offer to remain it is revealed that hwi had been grown inside an ixian no room mdash a device that shields its occupants from prescient view mdash from cells of a former ixian ambassador malky who had been a cynical and roguish friend of the god emperor through discussions with moneo and leto duncan learns about letos transformation the fish speakers and the oppressive measures leto takes to maintain his absolute control over the empire he begins to grow more agitated and restless though he continues in his duties defending the god emperor from an attack by tleilaxu face dancers duncan struggles with feelings of inadequacy and the confusion and disorientation that result from existing in a time alien to him duncan meets siona and though the two of them are coldly formal to one another they eventually unite to kill leto and end his tyrannical rule over mankind leto and hwi decide to marry and lead a wedding procession from letos little citadel to tuono village where duncan and siona have been sent while crossing the idaho river siona orders nayla to cut the supports of the bridge with a lasgun spilling moneo hwi leto and a number of courtiers into the jagged rocks in the canyon below nayla obeys despite her fanaticism toward the god emperor believing that the instructions are a test of her loyalty leto survives the fall but is immersed in water and his body begins to dissolve just as did the sandworms of ancient dune in a final conversation with siona and duncan leto reveals that siona is the embodiment of the golden path a human completely shielded from prescient view he explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles free to scatter throughout the universe never again to face complete domination after revealing the location of his secret spice hoard leto dies leaving duncan and siona to face the task of managing the empire

Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,heart of darkness opens in first person narrative our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat the nellie a cruising yawl anchored in the thames river near gravesend england it is somewhat hazy and late in the day aboard are four others the director of companies the captain the lawyer the best of old fellows the accountant toying architecturally with dominoes and marlow charlie marlow all share the bond of the sea but marlow is the only one that still followed the sea they are waiting for the tide waters to turn some undefined conversation is shared lazily the sun sets then marlow states how their location also has been one of the dark places of the earth marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first romans who made their way to england how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them he also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these romans must have been they were conquerors and for that you want only brute force after some silence marlow abruptly starts up again saying in a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn fresh water sailor for a bit marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river steamboat for an ivory trading company he describes his passage on ships to the wilderness to the companys station which strikes marlow as a scene of devastation amongst a waste of excavations disorganized machinery parts here and there now and then explosions of demolition weakened native black men that have been demoralized in chains literally being worked to death and strolling behind them a white company man in a uniform carrying a rifle marlow remarks on these company men ive seen the devil of violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by all the stars these were strong lusty red eyed devils that swayed and drove men men i tell you but as i stood on this hillside i foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become acquainted with a flabby pretending weak eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly how insidious he could be too i was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther at this station marlow meets the companys chief accountant whos dressed in unexpected elegance everything else in the station was in a muddle marlow first hears of a mr kurtz from the chief accountant who explains that kurtz is a first class agent and later adds he will be a somebody in the administration before long they above the council in europe you know mean him to be marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness to the central station where his steamboat is based the steamer he is to captain upon arrival at the central station the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival the manager explains to marlow that they couldnt wait and needed to take the steamboat up river because of rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy and its chief mr kurtz was ill marlow describes that the manager inspired uneasiness just uneasiness nothing more along with the manager marlow describes the other company men at this station as lazy back biting pilgrims fraught with envy and jealousy all trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the company which in turn would carry more personal profit but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting while trying to stay out of harms way after fishing his command out of the river frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs during this time marlow learns that at this station mr kurtz is far from being admired but instead more or less kurtz is resented mostly by the manager not only is kurtzs position at the inner station a highly envied position but sentiment seems to be that kurtz is not deserving of it as kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in europe once ready and underway the journey up river to the inner station kurtzs station takes two months to the day on board was the manager three or four pilgrims and about twenty cannibals that were enlisted to crew the steamer marlow describes the brooding wilderness in all its glory and in all its mystery here and there would be a company post where company agents seemed imprisoned captive by the business of ivory now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen with a frenzied uproar by the natives marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting kurtz but things become more tense as they get closer to his station they come to rest for the night about eight miles below the inner station in the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog from the river bank they hear a very loud cry followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking which stopped short the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap many wondered if there would be an attack but it was not until a few hours onwards while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks little arrows everywhere aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore the little arrows looked as though they wouldnt kill a cat the pilgrims with their winchesters had opened fire into the bush the native who had been serving as helmsman gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river the helmsman fell at marlows feet clutching a shaft of a spear which had entered his body just below the ribs marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out sharply then silence a pilgrim in pink pyjamas arrives at the pilot house and is shocked to see the dying helmsman they watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face marlow forces the pilgrim in pink pyjamas to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes and while flinging the pair overboard he is hit with a rush of thoughts thinking he would never have a chance to hear kurtz talk as he is most likely dead then submits of course i was wrong the privilege was waiting for me oh yes i heard more than enough marlow makes a vague mention of a girl whom later kurtz will refer to as my intended his fianc e you should have heard him say my ivory oh yes i heard him my intended my ivory my station my river my everything belonged to him marlow reflects more on kurtz his mother was half english his father was half french all europe contributed to the making of kurtz i learned that most appropriately the international society for the suppression of savage customs had entrusted him with the making of a report for its future guidance and he had written it too ive seen it ive read it it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of a method it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying like a flash of lightning in a serene sky exterminate all the brutes the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career after reflecting more on kurtz marlow states i cant forget him though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him i missed my late helmsman awfully dont you see he had done something he had steered and thus a subtle bond had been created of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken after putting on a pair of slippers marlow returned to the pilot house and resumed steering by this time the manager is there and expresses a strong desire to turn back right at the moment that the inner station comes into view at kurtzs station marlow sees a man on the river bank waving his arm urging them to land because of his expressions gestures and all the colorful patches on his clothing the man reminds marlow of a harlequin the pilgrims heavily armed escort the manager on shore to retrieve mr kurtz the harlequin like chap boards the steamboat it turns out the man is russian and he is a mere wanderer who just happened to wander into kurtzs camp he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case dont you talk with mr kurtz i said you dont talk with that man you listen to him he exclaimed with severe exaltation i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind through conversation marlow discovers just how wanton kurtz could be how the natives worshiped kurtz and how very ill kurtz has been of late the concerned harlequin like russian admires mr kurtz for his intellect for his insights into love life and justice the russian seems to even admire kurtz for his power and his willingness to use it marlow suggests that kurtz has gone mad and the russian protested indignantly mr kurtz couldnt be mad if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldnt dare hint at such a thing from the steamboat through a glass telescope marlow can observe details of the station and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared bearing kurtz on an improvised stretcher the area then filled with natives who appeared to be ready for battle the russian stated now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for on the stretcher marlow could see kurtz shouting the pilgrims carried kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins a gorgeous native woman with a desperate aspect walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer she raised her arms above her head then turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into the bushes from the steamboats cabin kurtz was placed in he is heard yelling at the manager save me save the ivory you mean dont tell me save me why ive had to save you you are interrupting my plans now sick sick not so sick as you would like to believe the manager walks out of the cabin and spoke with marlow about unsound methods and marlow puts forward the notion no method at all after some more words the manager gives marlow a heavy glance then leaves the russian mentions matters that would affect mr kurtzs reputation marlow replied to the russian mr kurtzs reputation is safe with me he informed marlow that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer the harlequin like russian refers to a canoe waiting for him and adds ah ill never never meet such a man again you ought to have heard him recite poetry his own too it was he told me poetry he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights oh he enlarged my mind good bye said i he shook hands and vanished in the night later after midnight marlow discovers that kurtz has left his cabin he has left the steamer and has returned to shore marlow goes ashore and finds kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station but not so weak as he can still call out to the natives marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in and when kurtz begins a threatening tone marlow interjects that his success in europe is assured in any case kurtz agrees to allow marlow to help him back to the steamer the next day they prepare for their departure they carried kurtz to the pilot house there was more air there the natives once again assembled on shore and the native woman returned they all began to shout marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore only the woman remained unmoved with outstretched arms the pilgrims opened fire the current was swift as they headed downstream kurtzs health was worsening marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill the steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made kurtz gives marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager while ill marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap unless i had the shakes too bad to stand he did not have much time for kurtz one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously i am lying here in the dark waiting for death the light was within a foot of his eyes i forced myself to murmur oh nonsense and stood over him as if transfixed as kurtz dies marlow hears him whisper in no more than a breath the horror the horror marlow blew out the candle and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims who were all in the mess room dining with the manager in a short while the managers boy appears and announces in a scathing tone mistah kurtz he dead next day marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury something in a muddy hole and then they very nearly buried me marlow falls very sick near death himself i have wrestled with death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine i was within a hairs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man he had something to say he said it since i had peeped over the edge myself i understand better he had summed up he had judged the horror he was a remarkable man after all this was the expression of some sort of belief it had candour it had conviction it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth the strange commingling of desire and hate he had made that last stride he had stepped over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible perhaps i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt better his cry much better upon marlows return to europe he seems embittered the everyday life of the europeans seem to be something a sham like some sort of hoax eventually marlow took care of the bundle of papers kurtz had entrusted to him to a clean shaven man who had an official manner marlow gave the paper entitled suppression of savage customs with the postscriptum torn off to another who claims to be kurtzs cousin marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance to a journalist he gave a report for publication if the journalist saw fit finally marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girls portrait kurtzs fianc e his intended at her door even before marlow entered her house memories of kurtz began to flow along with the final words that he whispered the girl came forward dressed in black and met marlow in a drawing room although it has been more than a year since kurtz died she was still in mourning it was late and the room was growing darker the final words of kurtzs seemed to echo in the room with the girl marlow envisioned them together i saw her and him in the same instant of time his death and her sorrow i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death she presses marlow for information ultimately asking him to repeat the final words kurtz had spoken being very uncomfortable marlow tells her that the final words that kurtz pronounce was her name marlow was surprised by her reaction i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain i knew it i was sure she knew she was sure i heard her weeping i wonder if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due hadnt he said he wanted only justice but i couldnt i could not tell her it would have been too dark too dark altogether then marlow and his listeners were silent our first narrator explains nobody moved for a time we have lost the first of the ebb said the director suddenly i raised my head the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
Heretics of Dune,Frank Herbert,much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the god emperor sandworms have reappeared on arrakis now called rakis and renewed the flow of the all important spice melange to the galaxy with letos death a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great scattering a new civilization has risen with three dominant powers the ixians whose no ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection the bene tleilax who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of face dancers and the bene gesserit a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities however people from the scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers the most powerful of these forces are the honored matres a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men on rakis a girl called sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms the bene gesserit intends to use a tleilaxu provided duncan idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider and the religious forces of mankind who they know will ultimately worship her the sisterhood have subtly been altering the gholas to bring their physical reflexes up to modern standards the bene gesserit leader mother superior taraza brings miles teg to guard the new idaho taraza also sends reverend mother darwi odrade to take command of the bene gesserit keep on rakis odrade is a loose cannon she

starts training sheeana as a bene gesserit at about the same time an attempt is made on the life of idaho but teg is able to defeat it teg flees with duncan and lucilla into the countryside in an ancient harkonnen no globe teg proceeds to awaken idahos original memories but does so before lucilla can imprint duncan and thus tie him to the sisterhood in the meantime taraza has been searching for teg and his party and finally establishes contact during the operation however teg and his companions are ambushed teg is captured while lucilla and duncan escape teg is tortured by a t probe but under pressure discovers a new ability he is able to speed up his physical and mental reactions which enables him to escape at the same time idaho is ambushed and taken hostage taraza arranges a meeting with the tleilaxu master waff who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the honored matres when pressed on the issue of idaho he also admits that the bene tleilax have conditioned

meet waff again on rakis he tries to assassinate taraza but odrade convinces him that the sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the bene tleilax taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the scattering this agreement causes consternation among the bene gesserit but odrade realizes that tarazas plan is to destroy rakis by destroying the planet the bene gesserit would be dependent on the tleilaxu for the spice ensuring an alliance lucilla arrives at a bene gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by honored matres who have idaho as their captive as lucilla infiltrates it the young honored matre murbella proceeds to seduce the captured idaho with the honored matre imprinting method however hidden tleilaxu conditioning kicks in

presence they print fake bills for an escaped slave and later they paint him up entirely in blue and call him the sick arab on one occasion they arrive in a town and advertise a three night engagement of a play which they call the royal nonesuch the play turns out to be only a couple of minutes of hysterical cavorting not worth anywhere near the cents the townsmen were charged to see it on the afternoon of the first performance a drunk called boggs arrives in town and makes a nuisance of himself by going around threatening a southern gentleman by the name of colonel sherburn sherburn comes out and warns boggs that he can continue threatening him up until exactly one oclock at one oclock boggs continues and colonel sherburn kills him somebody in the crowd whom sherburn later identifies as buck harkness cries out that sherburn should be lynched they all head up to colonel sherburns gate where they are met by sherburn who is standing on his porch carrying a loaded shotgun and his three legged dalmatian he causes them to back down by making a defiant speech telling them about the essential cowardice of southern justice the only lynching to be done here says sherburn will be in the dark by men wearing masks by the third night of the royal nonesuch the townspeople are ready to take their revenge but the duke and the king have already skipped town and together with huck and jim they continue down the river once they are far enough away the two grifters test the next town and decide to impersonate two brothers of peter wilks a recently deceased man of property using an absurd english accent the king manages to convince nearly all the townspeople that he is one of the brothers a preacher just arrived from england while the duke pretends to be a deaf mute to match accounts of the other brother one man in town is certain that they are a fraud and confronts them on the matter but the crowd refuses to support him afterwards the duke out of fear suggests to the king that they should cut and run the king boldly states his intention to continue to liquidate wilks estate saying haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town huck likes wilks daughters who treat him with kindness and courtesy so he tries to thwart the grifters plans by stealing back the inheritance money when he is in danger of being discovered he has to hide it in wilks coffin which is buried the next morning without huck knowing whether the money has been found or not the arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion when none of their signatures match the one on record the deaf mute brother who is said to do the correspondence has his arm in a sling and cannot currently write the townspeople devise a test which requires digging up the coffin to check when the money is found in wilks coffin the duke and the king are able to escape in the confusion they manage to rejoin huck and jim on the raft to hucks despair since he had thought he had escaped them after the four fugitives have drifted far enough from the town the king takes advantage of hucks temporary absence to sell his interest in the escaped slave jim for forty dollars outraged by this betrayal huck rejects the advice of his conscience which continues to tell him that in helping jim escape to freedom he is stealing miss watsons property accepting that all right then ill go to hell huck resolves to free jim jim is being held at the plantation of silas and sally phelps in a surprise twist they are revealed to be tom sawyers aunt and uncle since tom is expected for a visit huck is mistaken for tom he plays along hoping to find jims location and free him when huck intercepts tom on the road and tells him

time the townspeople are ready for them the duke and king are captured by the townspeople and are tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail rather than simply sneaking jim out of the shed where he is being held tom develops an elaborate plan to free him involving secret messages hidden tunnels a rope ladder sent in jims food and other elements from popular novels including a note to the phelps warning them of a gang planning to steal their runaway slave during the resulting pursuit tom is shot in the leg jim remains with him rather than completing his escape risking recapture huck has long known jim was white on the inside although the doctor admires jims decency he betrays him to a passing skiff and jim is captured while sleeping and returned to the phelps family after jims recapture events quickly resolve themselves toms aunt polly arrives and reveals huck and toms true identities tom announces that jim is a free man miss watson died two months earlier and freed jim in her will but tom chose not to reveal jims freedom so he could come up with an elaborate plan to rescue jim jim tells huck that hucks father has been dead for some time he was the dead man they

for this voyage hunting down and killing moby dick an old very large sperm whale with a snow white hump and mottled skin that crippled ahab on his last whaling voyage only starbuck shows any sign of resistance to the charismatic but monomaniacal captain the first mate argues repeatedly that the ship s purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil with luck returning home profitably safely and quickly but not to seek out and kill moby dick in particular nbsp and especially not for revenge eventually even starbuck acquiesces to ahabs will though harboring misgivings the mystery of the dark figures seen before the pequod set sail is explained during the voyages first lowering for whales ahab has secretly brought along his own boat crew including a mysterious harpooneer named fedallah

their twin deaths the novel describes numerous gams social meetings of two ships on the open sea crews normally visit each other during a gam captains on one vessel and chief mates on the other mail

widespread destruction including the disappearance of fedallah on the third day moby dick rises up to reveal fedallahs corpse tied to him by harpoon ropes even after the initial battle on the third day it is clear that while ahab is a vengeful whale hunter moby dick while dangerous and fearless is not motivated to hunt humans as he swims away from the pequod starbuck exhorts ahab one last time to desist observing that ahab ignores this voice of reason and continues with his ill fated chase as the three boats sail out to hunt him moby dick damages two of them forcing them to go back to the ship and leaving only ahabs vessel intact ahab harpoons the whale but the harpoon line breaks moby dick then rams the pequod itself which begins to sink as ahab harpoons the whale again the unfolding harpoon line catches him around his neck and he is dragged into the depths of the sea by the diving moby dick the boat is caught up in the whirlpool of the sinking ship which takes almost all the crew to their deaths only ishmael survives clinging to queequeg s coffin turned life buoy for an entire day and night before the rachel rescues him

the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate sense net a street gang named the panther moderns are hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on sense net the diversion allows molly to penetrate the building and steal dixies rom case and molly continue to investigate armitage discovering his former identity of colonel willis corto corto was a member of operation screaming fist which planned on infiltrating and disrupting soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over russia the russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible but the military went ahead with screaming fist with a new secret purpose of testing these russian defenses as the operation team attacked a soviet computer center emp weapons shut down their computers and flight systems and corto and his men were targeted by soviet laser defenses he and a few survivors commandeered a soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded finnish border everyone was killed except corto who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by finnish defense forces attacking as they were landing the helicopter corto after some months in hospital is visited by a government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realise was fake testimony designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the emp weapons after the trials corto snaps killing the government official who contacted him and then disappears into the criminal underworld in istanbul the team recruits peter riviera an artist thief and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants although riviera is a sociopath armitage coerces him into joining the team the trail leads case and molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named wintermute created by the plutocratic tessier ashpool family who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside villa straylight a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of freeside a cylindrical space habitat located at l and functioning primarily as a las vegas style space resort for the wealthy wintermutes nature is finally revealed it is one half of a super ai entity planned by the family although its exact purpose is unknown the turing law code governing ais bans the construction of such entities to get around this it had to be built as two separate ais wintermute was programmed by the tessier ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half neuromancer unable to achieve this merger on its own wintermute recruited armitage and his team to help complete the goal case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the turing imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program at the same time riviera is to obtain the password to the turing lock from lady jane marie france tessier ashpool an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of tessier ashpool sa wintermute believes riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her and that she will give him the password the password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the tessier ashpool home in villa straylight and entered simultaneously as case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace otherwise the turing lock will remain intact armitages team attracts the attention of the turing police whose job is to prevent ais from exceeding their built in limitations as molly and riviera gain entrance to villa straylight three officers arrest case and take him into custody wintermute manipulates the orbital casinos security and maintenance systems and kills the officers allowing case to escape the armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the corto personality as he relives screaming fist it is revealed that in the past wintermute had originally contacted corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence eventually convincing corto that he was armitage wintermute used him to persuade case and molly to help it merge with its twin ai neuromancer finally armitage becomes the shattered corto again but his newfound personality is short lived as he is killed by wintermute inside villa straylight molly is captured by riviera and lady jane worried about molly and operating under orders from wintermute case tracks her down with help from maelcum his rastafarian pilot neuromancer attempts to trap case within a cyber construct where he finds the consciousness of linda lee his girlfriend from chiba city who was murdered by one of cases underworld contacts case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay freeing himself case takes maelcum and confronts lady jane riviera and hideo lady janes ninja bodyguard riviera tries to kill case but lady jane is sympathetic towards case and molly and hideo protects him riviera blinds hideo but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight molly then explains to case that riviera is doomed anyway as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs which she had spiked with lady jane in possession of the password the team makes it to the computer terminal case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target lady jane is induced to give up her password and the lock is opened wintermute unites with neuromancer fusing into a greater entity the poison in cases bloodstream is washed out and he and molly are handsomely paid for their efforts while pauleys rom construct is apparently erased at his own request in the epilogue molly leaves case case finds a new girlfriend resumes his hacking work and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use wintermute neuromancer contacts him saying that it has become the sum total of the works the whole show and has begun looking for other ais like itself scanning old recorded transmissions from the s the super ai finds a lone ai transmitting from the alpha centauri star system in the matrix case hears inhuman laughter a trait associated with pauley during cases work with his rom construct thus suggesting that pauley was not erased after all but instead worked out a side deal with wintermute neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix in the end while logged into the matrix case catches a glimpse of himself his dead girlfriend linda lee and neuromancer the implication of the sighting is that neuromancer created a copy of cases consciousness when it previously tried to trap him the copy of cases consciousness now exists with that of lindas in the matrix where they are together forever
Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,the action takes place in two periods the second world war and the late s during the internet boom in lawrence pritchard waterhouse a young u s navy code breaker and mathematical genius is assigned to the newly formed joint british and american detachment this ultra secret units role is to hide the fact that allied intelligence has cracked the german enigma code the detachment stages events often behind enemy lines that provide alternative explanations for the allied intelligence successes marine sergeant bobby shaftoe a veteran of china and guadalcanal serves in unit carrying out waterhouses plans at the same time japanese soldiers including mining engineer goto dengo an old friend of shaftoes are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission circa randy waterhouse lawrences grandson joins his old dungeons and dragons companion avi halaby in a new startup providing pinoy grams to migrant filipinos via new fiber optic cables the aptly named epiphyte corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional sultanate of kinakuta vietnam veteran doug shaftoe and his daughter amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by goto furudenendu heir apparent to goto engineering complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge
No Logo,Naomi Klein,the book comprises four sections no space no choice no jobs and no logo the first three deal with the negative effects of brand oriented corporate activity while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back the book begins by tracing the history of brands klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding there is an actual clothing brand nologo which has existed since the late s and can be seen at www nologo com this is an excellent example of this shift to an anti brand brand early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory produced products these slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles according to klein in response to an economic crash in the s latin american debt crisis black monday savings and loan crisis japanese asset price bubble corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and began to target the youth demographic as opposed to the baby boomers who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment the book discusses how brand names such as nike or pepsi expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere as this happened the brands obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered cool along the way the brands attempted to have their names associated with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements klein argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products this theme recurs in the book and klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in third world countries in such industries as clothing footwear and computer hardware this section also looks at ways in which brands have muscled their presence into the school system and how in doing so they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and have used their position to gather information about the students klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers in the second section klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public whether through market dominance wal mart or through aggressive invasion of a region starbucks klein argues that the goal of each company is to become the dominant force in its respective field meanwhile other corporations such as sony or disney simply open their own chains of stores preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves this section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image abc news for instance is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of disney its parent company other chains such as wal mart often threaten to pull various products off of their shelves forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands this might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with wal marts image of family friendliness also discussed is the way that corporations abuse copyright laws in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand in this section the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries and particularly to places known as export processing zones such zones have no labor laws leading to dire working conditions the book then shifts back to north america where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits the term mcjob is introduced defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation inflexible or undesirable hours little chance of advancement and high levels of stress meanwhile the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits all of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector the result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for this resentment along with rising unemployment labour abuses abroad disregard for the environment and the ever increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations the final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the s these include adbusters magazine and the culture jamming movement as well as reclaim the streets and the mclibel trial less radical protests are also discussed such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to sweatshop labour klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship opting for the latter when i started this book she writes i honestly didnt know whether i was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad based movement but as time went on what i clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes
The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Philip K. Dick,the story begins in a future world where global warming has resulted in global temperatures so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours in a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on earth the un has initiated a draft for colonizing the nearby planets where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug can d in concert with layouts layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonist in their marginal off world colonies or even earth where global warming has progressed to the point that antarctica is prime vacation resort territory the illegal drug can d allows people to share their experience of the perky pat the name of the main female character in the simulated world layouts this sharing has caused a pseudo religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug up to the point where the novel begins new york city based perky pat or p p layouts inc has held a monopoly on this product as well as on the illegal trade in the drug can d which makes the shared hallucinations possible the novel opens shortly after barney mayerson p p layouts top precognitive someone who can glimpse future possibilities and sort out the most likely to actually occur has received a draft notice from the un for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on mars mayerson is sleeping with his assistant roni fugate but remains conflicted about the divorce which he himself initiated from his first wife emily a ceramic pot artist meanwhile emilys second husband tries to sell her pot designs to p p layouts as possible accessories for the perky pat virtual worlds but barney recognizing them as emilys rejects them out of spite meanwhile the un rescues palmer eldritchs ship from a crash on pluto leo bulero head of p p layouts and an evolved human meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a german doctor which are supposed to push the client forward on an evolutionary scale and which result in gross physical as well as mental modifications hears rumors that eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the prox system with similar properties to can d and that he plans to market it as chew z with u n approval on off world colonies however chew z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of chew z even more addictive than can d has been this would effectively destroy p p layouts bulero tries to contact eldritch but he is quarantined at a u n hospital both mayerson and fugate have precognitions of reports that bulero is going to be responsible for murdering eldritch meanwhile emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy unfortunately emily begins to devolve rather than evolving this devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older less sophisticated designs from earlier work without realizing it under the guise of a reporter bulero travels to eldritchs estate on the moon where eldritch holds a press conference bulero is kidnapped and forced to take chew z intravenously he enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and eldritch seemingly have some control after wrangling about business with eldritch bulero travels to what appears to be earth at some time in the not too distant future evolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of eldritch an enemy of the sol system bulero returns to earth and fires mayerson because mayerson was afraid to travel to the moon to rescue him mayerson in despair accepts his un conscription to mars but bulero recruits him as a double agent mayerson is to inject himself with a virus after taking chew z in a plot to deceive the un into thinking chew z is harmful and cause them to ban it on mars mayerson buys some chew z from eldritch who appears in holographic form mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with emily but finds that he does not control his hallucination like bulero he finds himself in the future mayerson arrives in new york two years hence where he speaks with bulero fugate and his future self about the death of palmer eldritch he also encounters several manifestations of eldritch identifiable by their robotic right hand artificial eyes and steel teeth eldritch offers to help mayerson become whatever he wants but in fact is so manipulative and controlling of the chew z alternate reality that mayerson ultimately decides hed rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by eldritch when a despairing mayerson chooses death he finds himself apparently forced into eldritchs body right at the point in the timeline where bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at eldritchs ship it appears that eldritchs plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in mayersons body while allowing mayerson himself to die in eldritchs place eldritch meanwhile intends to live on in mayersons form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a martian colonist mayerson stuck in eldritchs body and mistaken for him is indeed nearly killed by bulero in the near future but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his chew z trance in the present by bulero who has just arrived on mars bulero is willing to take mayerson back to earth but refuses to after learning that mayerson did not inject himself with the virus mayerson is now confident that bulero will kill eldritch so the sacrifice of taking the virus in order to ruin eldritchs business is unnecessary but he does not try to convince bulero of this later mayerson discusses his experience with a neo christian colonist and they conclude that either eldritch became a god in the prox system or some god like being has taken his place mayerson is convinced some aspect of eldritch is still inside him and that as long as he refuses to take chew z again it is eldritch who will actually be killed by bulero in the near future mayerson is half resigned half hopeful about taking on the life of a martian colonist without reprieve mayerson considers the possibility of eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god but inimical or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god the novel has an ambiguous ending with bulero heading back toward earth and apparent proliferation of eldritchs cyborg bodily stigmata which may mean that bulero is still trapped in eldritchs hallucinatory domain or that chew z is becoming increasingly popular amongst terrans and martian colonists

Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead,Tom Stoppard,the play opens with rosencrantz and guildenstern betting on coin flips rosencrantz who bets heads each time wins ninety two flips in a row the extreme unlikeliness of this event according to the laws of probability leads guildenstern to suggest that they may be within un sub or supernatural forces the reader learns why they are where they are the king has sent for them guildenstern theorizes on the nature of reality focusing on how an event becomes increasingly real as more people witness it a troupe of tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show they seem capable only of performances involving bloodbaths the next two scenes are from the plot of hamlet the first involving hamlet and ophelia takes place off stage in the shakespeare the second is taken directly from hamlet and is rosencrantz and guildensterns first appearance in that play here the danish king and queen claudius and gertrude ask the two to discover the nature of hamlets recent madness the royal couple demonstrate an inability to distinguish the two courtiers from one another as indeed do the characters themselves to their irritation rosencrantz and guildenstern attempt to practice for their meeting with the prince by one pretending to be hamlet and the other asking him questions but they glean no new information from it the act closes with another scene from hamlet in which they finally meet the prince face to face the act opens with the end of the conversation between rosencrantz guildenstern and hamlet guildenstern tries to look on the bright side while rosencrantz makes it clear that the pair had made no progress that hamlet had entirely outwitted them the player returns to the stage he is angry that the pair had not earlier stayed to watch their play because without an audience his tragedians are nothing he tells them to stop questioning their existence because upon examination life appears too chaotic to comprehend the player rosencrantz and guildenstern lose themselves in yet another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language the player leaves in order to prepare for his production of the murder of gonzago set to be put on in front of hamlet and the king and queen the royal couple enters and begins another short scene taken directly from hamlet they ask about the duos encounter with the prince and rosencrantz and guildenstern inform them about his interest in the tragedians production after the king and queen leave the partners contemplate their job they see hamlet walk by but fail to seize the opportunity to interview him the tragedians return and perform their dress rehearsal of the murder of gonzago the play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in hamlet characters resembling rosencrantz and guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of english courtiers foreshadowing their true fate rosencrantz does not quite make the connection but guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the tragedians inability to capture the real essence of death the stage becomes dark when the stage is once again visible rosencrantz and guildenstern lie in the same position as had the actors portraying their deaths the partners are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple claudius enters again and tells them to find where hamlet has hidden polonius corpse after many false starts they eventually find hamlet who leaves with the king rosencrantz is delighted to find that his mission is complete but guildenstern knows it is not over hamlet enters speaking with a norwegian soldier rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany hamlet to england because it means freedom from the orders of the danish court guildenstern understands that wherever they go they are still trapped in this world rosencrantz and guildenstern find themselves on a ship that has already set sail the audience is led to believe that the pair has no knowledge of how they got there at first they try to determine whether they are still alive eventually they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat they remember that claudius had given them a letter to deliver to england after some brief confusion over who actually has the letter they find it and end up opening it they realize that claudius has asked for hamlet to be killed while rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings the stage becomes black and presumably the characters go to sleep hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself an act which takes place off stage in hamlet the pair discovers that the tragedians are hidden impossibly according to the stage directions in several barrels on deck they are fleeing denmark because their play has offended claudius when rosencrantz complains that there is not enough action pirates attack hamlet rosencrantz and guildenstern and the player all hide in separate barrels the lights dim when the lights come on again hamlet has vanished in hamlet its reported that he was kidnapped by pirates from the ship rosencrantz and guildenstern panic and re read the letter to find that it now calls for them to be put to death instead of the prince guildenstern cannot understand why he and rosencrantz are so important as to necessitate their executions the player tells guildenstern that all paths end in death guildenstern snaps and draws the players dagger from his belt shouting at him that his portrayals of death do not do justice to the real thing he stabs the player and the player appears to die guildenstern honestly believes he has killed the player seconds later the tragedians begin to clap and the player stands up and brushes himself off revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade the tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of hamlet the lighting shifts so that rosencrantz and guildenstern are the only ones visible rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die still he resigns himself to his fate and his character disappears guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he could have stopped the series of events that has brought him to this point he disappears as well the final scene features the last few lines from shakespeares hamlet the ambassador from england announces that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
Ringworld,Larry Niven,the novel opens in louis gridley wu is celebrating his th birthday despite his age louis is in perfect physical condition but is bored he has experienced life thoroughly and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of known space all alone in a spaceship for a year or more he is confronted by nessus a piersons puppeteer and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond known space speaker to animals speaker who is a kzin and teela brown a young human woman also join the voyage they first travel to the puppeteer home world where they learn that the expeditions goal is to explore a ringworld an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of earths orbit which makes it about million miles in circumference encircling a sol type star it rotates providing artificial gravity that is as strong as earths gravity through the action of centrifugal force the ringworld has a habitable flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million earth sized planets night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin ultra strong wire shadow square wire none of the crews attempts at contacting the ringworld succeed and their ship is disabled by its automated meteor defense system the severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow square wire and crash lands on the ringworld near a huge mountain the ships defences keep the crew compartment and many of the ships systems intact including the faster than light drive hyperdrive but the normal drive is destroyed leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive the team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space as well as fulfilling their original mission learning more about the ringworld using their flycycles they try to reach the rim of the ring where they hope to find some technology that will help them it will take them months to cross the vast distance when teela develops plateau trance they find themselves forced to land on the ground they encounter apparently human ringworld natives the natives who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city think that the crew are the engineers of the ring whom they revere as gods the crew is attacked when they commit a blasphemy they continue their journey during which nessus is forced to reveal some puppeteer secrets they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans breeding for luck and kzin breeding for less aggressiveness the resulting hostility forces nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance they encounter a city and in a floating building they find a map of the ringworld and videos of its past civilization in a giant storm caused by air escaping through a hole in the ring floor due to meteor impact teela is blown away in an unknown direction while searching for her in a ruined city louis and speakers flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders they are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station nessus arrives entering the station to help his team in the station they meet halrloprillalar hotrufan prill a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the ringworld and other inhabited worlds her spaceship was stranded on the ringworld when the landing mechanism failed she relates what she learned of the downfall of the ringworlds civilization a mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship without its superconductive technology civilization fell teela reaches the police station accompanied by her new lover a native hero called seeker who helped her survive based on his studies of an ancient ringworld map louis devises a plan to escape the four explorers with seeker and prill use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers crashed ship along the way teela and seeker choose to remain behind to inhabit a flying castle and remain on ringworld the remaining explorers and prill collect one end of the shadow square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed dragging the wire behind them as they travel reaching the wreck louis threads the shadow wire through the crashed ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station and then continues to pull the wire onward up to the summit of fist of god the enormous mountain near their crash site the massive mountain does not appear on a map of the original ringworld leading louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteor impact with the underside of the ring which pushed the mountain up from the ring floor and broke through the top of the mountain above the edge of the rings atmosphere is therefore a passage to the underside of the ringworld and freedom louis drives the police station over the edge of the crater because the ringworld spins fast enough to provide gravity once the police station and ship are on the underside centrifugal force pushes them outward from the ring into open space the crew can then use the ships faster than light drive to get home the book concludes with louis and speaker discussing returning to the ringworld
Rendezvous with Rama,Arthur C. Clarke,after a major disaster caused by a meteorite falling in eastern italy in the government of earth sets up the spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space the rama of the title is an alien star ship initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as it is detected by astronomers in the year while still outside the orbit of jupiter the objects speed nbsp nbsp km h and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate that this is not an object on a long orbit around our sun it comes from interstellar space astronomers interest is further piqued when they realise that this asteroid not only has an extremely rapid rotation period of minutes but it is exceptionally large it is subsequently renamed rama after the hindu god and an unmanned space probe dubbed sita is launched from the mars moon phobos to intercept and photograph the object the resulting images taken during its rapid flyby reveal that rama is a perfect cylinder in diameter and long made of a completely featureless material making this humankinds first encounter with an alien space ship the manned solar survey vessel endeavour is sent to study rama as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period rama will spend in our solar system endeavour manages to rendezvous with rama one month after the space ship first comes to earths attention when the giant alien spacecraft is already within venus orbit the crew led by commander bill norton enters rama through triple airlocks and explores the vast km wide by km long cylindrical world of its interior but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remains enigmatic throughout the book inside rama the air is discovered to be breathable the astronauts discover several features including cities odd blocky shapes that look like buildings and streets with shallow trenches in them looking like trolley car tracks that actually served as factories a sea that stretches in a band around rama dubbed the cylindrical sea and seven massive cones at the southern end of rama believed to form part of the propulsion system one of the crew members jimmy pak who has experience with low gravity skybikes volunteers to ride a smuggled skybike along ramas axis to the far end otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the m high cliff on the opposite shore a few hours later jimmy reaches the massive metal cones on the southern end of rama picking up a strange magnetic field coming from the cones pak takes a few pictures of the area and the strange plateau on the southern end of ramas landmass before leaving the electrical charge in the atmosphere begins to increase during paks return resulting in lightning a discharge hits his skybike causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent when pak wakes up he sees a crab like creature picking up his skybike and chopping it into pieces he cannot decide whether it is a robot or a biological alien and keeps his distance while contacting norton and the others on the other side of rama for help norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea using a small improvised craft and pak waits he sees the crab like creature dump the remains of the skybike into the sea and he approaches the creature but it completely ignores him pak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea amongst the strange geometric patterns he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research pak jumps off the m cliff his descent slowed by low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute and swims quickly to the craft the ride back is highlighted by tidal waves in the cylindrical sea formed by movements of rama itself as it makes course corrections when the crew arrive at base they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp when one is found damaged and apparently lifeless the teams doctor biologist surgeon commander laura ernst inspects it and names it a biot or a hybrid of a biological entity and robot she concludes that it and others appear to be electrically powered by natural internal batteries much like terrestrial electric eels and possess some degree of intelligence they are believed to be the servants of ramas still absent builders and maintainers of the starship the members of the rama committee and the united planets both based on the moon have been monitoring events inside rama and giving feedback the hermian colonists have concluded that rama is a potential threat to them and send a rocket mounted bomb to destroy rama it is successfully defused by lt boris rodrigo using a pair of wire cutters as rama approaches perihelion the biots act strangely jumping into the cylindrical sea where they are destroyed by aquatic biots sharks and absorbed back into the mineral laden water on one last expedition to explore rama a few crew members decide to visit the city london chosen as closest to the stairways at the northern end of the cylinder they use to return to their ship to use a laser to cut open one of the buildings and see what is inside inside they discover pedestals containing holograms of various artifacts believed to have been used by the ramans as tools and other objects the holograms themselves are presumed to be templates for replicating these items as needed the most amazing sight is what appears to be a uniform with bandoliers straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the ramans but before the crew can photograph any more holograms the lights start going out and they must leave they all exit up through the stairway on ramas northern side out of the three airlocks and board endeavour when endeavour is a safe distance away and rama reaches perihelion rama harnesses the suns gravitational field with its mysterious space drive for use in a slingshot manoeuvre and is flung out of the solar system toward an unknown location in the direction of the large magellanic cloud the book was meant to stand alone although the final sentence of the book suggests otherwise clarke however denied that this sentence was meant to hint at a continuation of the story according to his foreword in the books sequel it was just a good way to end the book and was added during a final revision
