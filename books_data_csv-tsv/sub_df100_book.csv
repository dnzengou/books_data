Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes,the first sally alonso quijano the protagonist of the novel is a retired country gentleman nearing fifty years of age living in an unnamed section of la mancha with his niece and housekeeper while mostly a rational man of sound reason his reading of books of chivalry in excess has had a profound effect on him leading to the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties in essence he believes every word of these books of chivalry to be true though for the most part the content of these books is clearly fiction otherwise his wits in regards to everything other than chivalry are intact he decides to go out as a knight errant in search of adventure he dons an old suit of armour renames himself don quixote de la mancha and names his skinny horse rocinante he designates a neighboring farm girl as his lady love renaming her dulcinea del toboso while she knows nothing about this he sets out in the early morning and ends up at an inn which he believes to be a castle he asks the innkeeper whom he thinks to be the lord of the castle to dub him a knight he spends the night holding vigil over his armor where he becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules the innkeeper then dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way don quixote next frees a young boy who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master by making his master swear on the chivalric code to treat the boy fairly the boys beating is continued as soon as quixote leaves don quixote has a run in with traders from toledo who insult the imaginary dulcinea one of whom severely beats don quixote and leaves him on the side of the road don quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant the second sally while don quixote is unconscious in his bed his niece the housekeeper the parish curate and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off after a short period of feigning health don quixote approaches his neighbor sancho panza and asks him to be his squire promising him governorship of an island the uneducated sancho agrees and the pair sneak off in the early dawn it is here that their series of famous adventures begin starting with don quixotes attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants the two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage they are heavily cloaked as is the lady to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road don quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive he knocks a friar from his horse and is immediately challenged by an armed basque traveling with the company as he has no shield the basque uses a pillow to protect himself which saves him when don quixote strikes him the combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and demanding those traveling with her to surrender to don quixote the pastoral wanderings sancho and don quixote go on and fall in with a group of goatherds don quixote tells sancho and the goatherds about the golden age of man reminiscent of both ovid and the later rousseau in which property does not exist and men live in peace the goatherds invite the knight and sancho to the funeral of gris stomo once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels seeking the shepherdess marcela at the funeral marcela appears delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by gris stomo claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich s she disappears into the woods and don quixote and sancho follow ultimately giving up the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest some galicians arrive to water their ponies and rocinante don quixotes horse attempts to mate with the ponies the galicians hit rocinante with clubs to dissuade him which don quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend rocinante the galicians beat don quixote and sancho leaving them in great pain the adventures with cardenio and dorotea after don quixote frees a group of galley slaves the knight and sancho wander into the sierra morena and there encounter the dejected cardenio cardenio relates the first part of his story in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend luscinda and is hired as the companion to the dukes son leading to his friendship with the dukes younger son don fernando cardenio confides in don fernando his love for luscinda and the delays in their engagement caused by cardenios desire to keep with tradition after reading cardenios poems praising luscinda don fernando falls in love with her don quixote interrupts when cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels in the course of their travels the protagonists meet innkeepers prostitutes goatherds soldiers priests escaped convicts and scorned lovers these encounters are magnified by don quixote s imagination into chivalrous quests don quixote s tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him and his habit of not paying his debts result in many privations injuries and humiliations with sancho often getting the worst of it finally don quixote is persuaded to return to his home village the author hints that there was a third quest but says that records of it have been lost the third sally although the two parts are now normally published as a single work don quixote part two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel while part one was mostly farcical the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception as part two begins it is assumed that the literate classes of spain have all read the first part of the history of don quixote and his squire cervantess meta fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of part one as well as with an actually published fraudulent part two when strangers encounter the duo in person they already know their famous history a duke and duchess and others deceive don quixote for entertainment setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes some of them are quite sadistic and they put don quixotes sense of chivalry and his devotion to dulcinea through many tests even sancho deceives him at one point pressured into finding dulcinea sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls and tells don quixote that they are dulcinea and her ladies in waiting when don quixote only sees the peasant girls sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when as part of one of the duke and duchesss pranks the two are led to believe that the only method to release dulcinea from her spell is for sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes sancho naturally resists this course of action leading to friction with his master under the dukes patronage sancho eventually gets a governorship though it is false and proves to be a wise and practical ruler though this ends in humiliation as well near the end don quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity an inn is just an inn not a castle the lengthy untold history of don quixotes adventures in knight errantry comes to a close after his battle with the knight of the white moon in which we the readers find him conquered bound by the rules of chivalry don quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror which in this case is that don quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year a duration in which he may be cured of his madness defeated and dejected he and sancho start their journey home part two of don quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about this is a theme much explored in writings of the th century upon returning to his village don quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd although his housekeeper who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs soon after he retires to his bed with a deathly illness possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations one day he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity sancho tries to restore his faith but alonso quixano for that is his true name can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused he dictates his will which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry after alonso quixano dies the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about don quixote would be spurious
Dune Messiah,Frank Herbert,twelve years after the events described in dune paul muaddib atreides rules as emperor by accepting the role of messiah to the fremen paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe while paul is the most powerful emperor ever known he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created although sixty one billion people have perished pauls prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity motivated by this knowledge paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the fremen religion the bene gesserit spacing guild and tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone paul the bene gesserit reverend mother gaius helen mohiam enlisting pauls own consort princess irulan daughter of the deposed padishah emperor shaddam corrino iv paul has refused to father a child with irulan or even touch her but his fremen concubine chani has also failed to produce an heir causing tension within his monarchy desperate both to secure her place in the atreides dynasty and to preserve the atreides bloodline for the bene gesserit breeding program irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to chani paul is aware of this fact but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring chanis death and does not want to lose her because of the way oracles interfere with one anothers prescience the guild navigator edric is able to shield the conspiracy from pauls visions of the future the tleilaxu face dancer scytale gives paul a gift he cannot resist a tleilaxu grown ghola of the deceased duncan idaho pauls childhood teacher and friend now called hayt the conspirators hope the presence of hayt will undermine pauls ability to rule by forcing paul to question himself and the empire he has created furthermore pauls acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the fremen who see the tleilaxu and their tools as unclean chani taking matters into her own hands switches to a traditional fremen fertility diet preventing irulan from being able to tamper with her food and soon becomes pregnant otheym one of pauls former fedaykin death commandos reveals evidence of a fremen conspiracy against paul otheym gives paul his dwarf tleilaxu servant bijaz who like a recording machine can remember faces names and details paul accepts reluctantly seeing the strands of a tleilaxu plot as pauls soldiers attack the conspirators others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner purchased from the tleilaxu that destroys the area and blinds paul by tradition all blind fremen are abandoned in the desert but paul shocks the fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see even without eyes his oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens as though his eyes still function by moving through his life in lockstep with his visions he can see even the slightest details of the world around him the disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted the unraveling of the fremen conspiracy reveals that korba a former fedaykin and now high priest of pauls church is among pauls enemies hayt interrogates bijaz but the little man actually an agent of the tleilaxu uses a specific humming intonation that renders hayt open to implanted commands bijaz programs hayt to offer paul a bargain when chani dies chanis rebirth as a ghola and the hope that duncan idahos memories might be reawakened in return for paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force hayt to attempt to kill paul given the appropriate circumstances hayt remains oblivious of the programming eventually news is brought that chani has died giving birth pauls reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of hayt who attempts to kill paul but rather than kill his beloved paul duncans ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers duncans full consciousness he remains conscious of the zen sunni and mentat training given to hayt by the tleilaxu but is no longer bound to their programming paul and chanis newborn twins are pre born like pauls sister alia had been and come into the world fully conscious with kwisatz haderach like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in chanis special pregnancy diet scytale offers to revive chani as a ghola in return for all of pauls choam holdings paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the tleilaxu might program chani in some diabolical way and scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with alia paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son yet he is able to kill scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his sons perspective now prophetically as well as physically blind paul chooses to embrace the fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert winning the fealty of the fremen for his children who will inherit his mantle of emperor paul leaves alia now romantically involved with duncan as regent for the twins whom he has named leto and ghanima duncan notes the irony that paul and chanis deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies and that paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man while

Darwin's Dangerous Idea,Daniel Dennett,starting in the middle part i of darwins dangerous idea gets its name from a quote by willard van orman quine analyze theory building how we will we all must start in the middle our conceptual firsts are middle sized middle distance objects and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race the first chapter tell me why is named after a song before charles darwin god was seen as the ultimate cause of all design or the ultimate answer to why questions john locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter and david hume while exposing problems with lockes view could not see any alternative darwin provided just such an alternative evolution besides providing evidence of common descent he introduced a mechanism to explain it natural selection according to dennett natural selection is a mindless mechanical and algorithmic process mdash darwins dangerous idea the third chapter introduces the concept of skyhooks and cranes see below he suggests that resistance to darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks which do not really exist according to dennett good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes chapter looks at the tree of life such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in lifes history the next chapter concerns the possible and the actual using the library of mendel the space of all logically possible genomes as a conceptual aid in the last chapter of part i dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified design space descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently however there are also forced moves or good tricks that will be discovered repeatedly either by natural selection see convergent evolution or human investigation the first chapter of part ii darwinian thinking in biology asserts that life originated without any skyhooks and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos the eighth chapters message is conveyed by its title biology is engineering biology is the study of design function construction and operation however there are some important differences between biology and engineering related to the engineering concept of optimization the next chapter deals with adaptationism which dennett endorses calling gould and lewontins refutation of it an illusion dennett thinks adaptationism is in fact the best way of uncovering constraints the tenth chapter entitled bully for brontosaurus is an extended critique of stephen jay gould who dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings his self styled revolutions against adaptationism gradualism and other orthodox darwinism all being false alarms the final chapter of part ii dismisses directed mutation the inheritance of acquired traits and teilhards omega point and insists that other controversies and hypotheses like the unit of selection and panspermia have no dire consequences for orthodox darwinism mind meaning mathematics and morality is the name of part iii which begins with a quote from nietzsche chapter the cranes of culture discusses cultural evolution it asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture and that it allows humans alone among animals to transcend our selfish genes losing our minds to darwin follows a chapter about the evolution of brains minds and language dennett criticizes noam chomskys perceived resistance to the evolution of language its modeling by artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the evolution of meaning is then discussed and dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless algorithmic processes chapter asserts that g dels theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible dennett extends his criticism to roger penrose the subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality beginning with thomas hobbes who dennett calls the first sociobiologist and friedrich nietzsche he concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense though he cautions against some varieties of greedy ethical reductionism before moving to the next chapter he discusses some sociobiology controversies the penultimate chapter entitled redesigning morality begins by asking if ethics can be naturalized dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems in the future of an idea the books last chapter dennett praises biodiversity including cultural diversity in closing he uses beauty and the beast as an analogy although darwins idea may seem dangerous it is actually quite beautiful

montag finds mildred in the kitchen making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed but is interrupted by mildreds ramblings of her stomach hurting but being hungry and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party as montag leaves for work he finally tells mildred who is watching an interactive soap opera

when the train comes to take him to work a few days later the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books the firemen go to arrest her but instead the

accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see the woman is given a final warning to leave the house but the woman produces a match before she can strike it the firemen flee save for montag who watches as the woman lights the match drops it in the kerosene and is engulfed in flames montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half asleep mildred where the two first met and when mildred tries to remember but cant laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills as montag reflects on his stagnant stilted marriage to mildred and how mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her parlor wall entertainment driving recklessly and her sleeping pill addiction montag begins to cry after realizing that if mildred died he wouldnt miss her at all montag then asks mildred about clarisse and her whereabouts mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to clarisse then tells montag exactly what happened to her clarisse was run over by a speeding car and once her family heard the news about her death they packed up and moved away all of

wakes up physically ill and begs mildred to call in sick for him mildred refuses and doesnt believe that montag is really sick even when montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene which earlier was like a perfume to him mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash captain beatty montags fire chief personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in over the course of several decades with the starting point being after the american civil war populations grew and people embraced new media sports and a quickening pace of life books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span later minorities and other special interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend books became blander and blander due to censorship measures and eventually books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile the only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics three dimensional sex magazines trade magazines and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls to get rid of the books from the past and their copies the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire resistant and placate the masses as beatty is giving his monologue mildred tries to fluff montags pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath montag yells at her and mildred at the request of beatty quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls beatty knows that montag has a book but acts casual about it stating that its natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one if the book isnt burned or returned to the firehouse

the stolen books and nearly getting caught by the firehouses mechanical hound mildred argues with montag that books have no meaning and questions why montag dragged her into this montag snaps back by mentioning mildreds overdose clarisses death the book woman who burned herself and how society is falling apart due to apathy ignorance and a pending war then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction before montag can finish mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch the white clown on the parlor walls montag laments that his wife is a lost cause and he will be too if he cant force himself to absorb the information in the books montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago faber a former english professor montag seeks fabers help though faber refuses at first due to his cowardice after montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of the new testament one of the few left that actually contains gods word rather than the bastardized versions that have jesus and other biblical characters shilling products faber relents and teaches montag about the importance of literature in its attempt to explain human existence he gives montag an ear piece communicator he made himself so that faber can offer guidance throughout his daily activities at montags house mildred has friends mrs phelps and mrs bowles over to watch the parlor walls in the middle of a bloody demolition derby montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war death their families and politics montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them despite fabers warnings mildred tries to cover up montags actions by claiming that once a year firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem dover beach on it and assures that none of her friends will understand any of the words a shaken confused montag reads the poem which ends up making mrs phelps cry mrs bowles however is disgusted accuses montag of being nasty and breaks off her friendship with mildred montag yells at the women to go home and reflect on their empty lives and burns the poetry book while mildred locks herself in the bathroom to take her pills montag returns to the firehouse the next day with only one of the books which beatty tosses into the trash beatty tells montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other in describing the dream beatty shows that despite his disillusionment he was once an enthusiastic reader a fire alarm goes off and

God Emperor of Dune,Frank Herbert,the seemingly immortal god emperor leto ii has ruled his empire for more than years his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in children of dune to merge his human body with sandtrout the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of arrakis his continued evolution has slowly transformed him altering his human form into what he calls a pre worm his body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of arrakis mdash ribbed elongated and covered in scaly sandtrout his face remains as do his hands and arms but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of ixian manufacture it is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form this distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm even allowing him to survive lasgun fire but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water during his long reign leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire both through tight control of his enormous but limited hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his fish speaker army the old imperium is basically non existent the landsraad has ceased to exist and only a few remnants of the great houses survive the bene gesserit and spacing guild have endured although both have been forced to adapt to letos absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience and choam has been reduced to a shadow of its former self his reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race letos enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life close to absolute prescience a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths as decades may pass without him realizing it few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the golden path the end justifying the means leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government and as god he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept as his father before him leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive mdash and thus control mdash is connected to his eventual death ironically this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of duncan idaho the faithful swordmaster of house atreides duncan functions both as the captain of letos guard and as a familiar face to calm leto in his moments of distress they remind leto of his family and he feels that he owes duncan for his service and devotion to house atreides the vast majority of these gholas are made under letos instructions of preserving the original idaho without enhancements idahos masterful abilities thus are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by letos servants over the centuries a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to house atreides and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation leto has forced upon the empire these feelings compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time drives some of the duncan idaho gholas insane even when he doesnt ask for a new ghola or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous idahos demise the tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival letos golden path as he calls it is a millennia spanning attempt to produce a human who is invisible to a watcher gifted with prescience this breeding plan begun with the marriage of letos twin sister ghanima to faradn corrino has resulted in letos majordomo moneo atreides and his daughter siona moneo has served leto faithfully for the majority of his life having been a rebel until he was shown the golden path in a test by leto siona is the leader of a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the god emperor and locate his hidden hoard of melange unbeknownst to siona nayla mdash her close friend and de facto bodyguard mdash worships leto and is under orders to protect and obey siona in all things while reporting on her rebellious activities although leto knows the important purpose of siona as long as she doesnt serve the golden path she would be expendable and he would have to take measures for the breeding paths that he would have to take to replace her during a raid on his citadel siona and her friends steal among other things a series of excerpts from letos private journal unknown to them leto is aware of their activities and allows them to continue in perusing some of the items and documents stolen from the citadel siona learns that leto remains capable of love and plots to use this as a weapon against him at the same time the new ixian ambassador hwi noree is sent to the court of the god emperor immediately entranced by her beauty grace and purity leto begins to be tortured by the knowledge that he and hwi are separated by his continued transformation for her part hwi desires nothing more than to serve the god emperor and she quickly becomes a confidante finally expressing her love of leto the latest incarnation of duncan is also captivated by hwis beauty but is rebuffed by leto who warns that hwi is his alone because of his intense feelings for hwi and the fact that she had never appeared in his prescient visions leto realizes that she is a trap trained and sent by the ixians to weaken him however he is unable to send her away and she gladly accepts his offer to remain it is revealed that hwi had been grown inside an ixian no room mdash a device that shields its occupants from prescient view mdash from cells of a former ixian ambassador malky who had been a cynical and roguish friend of the god emperor through discussions with moneo and leto duncan learns about letos transformation the fish speakers and the oppressive measures leto takes to maintain his absolute control over the empire he begins to grow more agitated and restless though he continues in his duties defending the god emperor from an attack by tleilaxu face dancers duncan struggles with feelings of inadequacy and the confusion and disorientation that result from existing in a time alien to him duncan meets siona and though the two of them are coldly formal to one another they eventually unite to kill leto and end his tyrannical rule over mankind leto and hwi decide to marry and lead a wedding procession from letos little citadel to tuono village where duncan and siona have been sent while crossing the idaho river siona orders nayla to cut the supports of the bridge with a lasgun spilling moneo hwi leto and a number of courtiers into the jagged rocks in the canyon below nayla obeys despite her fanaticism toward the god emperor believing that the instructions are a test of her loyalty leto survives the fall but is immersed in water and his body begins to dissolve just as did the sandworms of ancient dune in a final conversation with siona and duncan leto reveals that siona is the embodiment of the golden path a human completely shielded from prescient view he explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles free to scatter throughout the universe never again to face complete domination after revealing the location of his secret spice hoard leto dies leaving duncan and siona to face the task of managing the empire

Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,heart of darkness opens in first person narrative our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat the nellie a cruising yawl anchored in the thames river near gravesend england it is somewhat hazy and late in the day aboard are four others the director of companies the captain the lawyer the best of old fellows the accountant toying architecturally with dominoes and marlow charlie marlow all share the bond of the sea but marlow is the only one that still followed the sea they are waiting for the tide waters to turn some undefined conversation is shared lazily the sun sets then marlow states how their location also has been one of the dark places of the earth marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first romans who made their way to england how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them he also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these romans must have been they were conquerors and for that you want only brute force after some silence marlow abruptly starts up again saying in a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn fresh water sailor for a bit marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river steamboat for an ivory trading company he describes his passage on ships to the wilderness to the companys station which strikes marlow as a scene of devastation amongst a waste of excavations disorganized machinery parts here and there now and then explosions of demolition weakened native black men that have been demoralized in chains literally being worked to death and strolling behind them a white company man in a uniform carrying a rifle marlow remarks on these company men ive seen the devil of violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by all the stars these were strong lusty red eyed devils that swayed and drove men men i tell you but as i stood on this hillside i foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become acquainted with a flabby pretending weak eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly how insidious he could be too i was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther at this station marlow meets the companys chief accountant whos dressed in unexpected elegance everything else in the station was in a muddle marlow first hears of a mr kurtz from the chief accountant who explains that kurtz is a first class agent and later adds he will be a somebody in the administration before long they above the council in europe you know mean him to be marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness to the central station where his steamboat is based the steamer he is to captain upon arrival at the central station the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival the manager explains to marlow that they couldnt wait and needed to take the steamboat up river because of rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy and its chief mr kurtz was ill marlow describes that the manager inspired uneasiness just uneasiness nothing more along with the manager marlow describes the other company men at this station as lazy back biting pilgrims fraught with envy and jealousy all trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the company which in turn would carry more personal profit but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting while trying to stay out of harms way after fishing his command out of the river frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs during this time marlow learns that at this station mr kurtz is far from being admired but instead more or less kurtz is resented mostly by the manager not only is kurtzs position at the inner station a highly envied position but sentiment seems to be that kurtz is not deserving of it as kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in europe once ready and underway the journey up river to the inner station kurtzs station takes two months to the day on board was the manager three or four pilgrims and about twenty cannibals that were enlisted to crew the steamer marlow describes the brooding wilderness in all its glory and in all its mystery here and there would be a company post where company agents seemed imprisoned captive by the business of ivory now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen with a frenzied uproar by the natives marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting kurtz but things become more tense as they get closer to his station they come to rest for the night about eight miles below the inner station in the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog from the river bank they hear a very loud cry followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking which stopped short the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap many wondered if there would be an attack but it was not until a few hours onwards while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks little arrows everywhere aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore the little arrows looked as though they wouldnt kill a cat the pilgrims with their winchesters had opened fire into the bush the native who had been serving as helmsman gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river the helmsman fell at marlows feet clutching a shaft of a spear which had entered his body just below the ribs marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out sharply then silence a pilgrim in pink pyjamas arrives at the pilot house and is shocked to see the dying helmsman they watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face marlow forces the pilgrim in pink pyjamas to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes and while flinging the pair overboard he is hit with a rush of thoughts thinking he would never have a chance to hear kurtz talk as he is most likely dead then submits of course i was wrong the privilege was waiting for me oh yes i heard more than enough marlow makes a vague mention of a girl whom later kurtz will refer to as my intended his fianc e you should have heard him say my ivory oh yes i heard him my intended my ivory my station my river my everything belonged to him marlow reflects more on kurtz his mother was half english his father was half french all europe contributed to the making of kurtz i learned that most appropriately the international society for the suppression of savage customs had entrusted him with the making of a report for its future guidance and he had written it too ive seen it ive read it it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of a method it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying like a flash of lightning in a serene sky exterminate all the brutes the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career after reflecting more on kurtz marlow states i cant forget him though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him i missed my late helmsman awfully dont you see he had done something he had steered and thus a subtle bond had been created of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken after putting on a pair of slippers marlow returned to the pilot house and resumed steering by this time the manager is there and expresses a strong desire to turn back right at the moment that the inner station comes into view at kurtzs station marlow sees a man on the river bank waving his arm urging them to land because of his expressions gestures and all the colorful patches on his clothing the man reminds marlow of a harlequin the pilgrims heavily armed escort the manager on shore to retrieve mr kurtz the harlequin like chap boards the steamboat it turns out the man is russian and he is a mere wanderer who just happened to wander into kurtzs camp he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case dont you talk with mr kurtz i said you dont talk with that man you listen to him he exclaimed with severe exaltation i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind through conversation marlow discovers just how wanton kurtz could be how the natives worshiped kurtz and how very ill kurtz has been of late the concerned harlequin like russian admires mr kurtz for his intellect for his insights into love life and justice the russian seems to even admire kurtz for his power and his willingness to use it marlow suggests that kurtz has gone mad and the russian protested indignantly mr kurtz couldnt be mad if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldnt dare hint at such a thing from the steamboat through a glass telescope marlow can observe details of the station and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared bearing kurtz on an improvised stretcher the area then filled with natives who appeared to be ready for battle the russian stated now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for on the stretcher marlow could see kurtz shouting the pilgrims carried kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins a gorgeous native woman with a desperate aspect walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer she raised her arms above her head then turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into the bushes from the steamboats cabin kurtz was placed in he is heard yelling at the manager save me save the ivory you mean dont tell me save me why ive had to save you you are interrupting my plans now sick sick not so sick as you would like to believe the manager walks out of the cabin and spoke with marlow about unsound methods and marlow puts forward the notion no method at all after some more words the manager gives marlow a heavy glance then leaves the russian mentions matters that would affect mr kurtzs reputation marlow replied to the russian mr kurtzs reputation is safe with me he informed marlow that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer the harlequin like russian refers to a canoe waiting for him and adds ah ill never never meet such a man again you ought to have heard him recite poetry his own too it was he told me poetry he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights oh he enlarged my mind good bye said i he shook hands and vanished in the night later after midnight marlow discovers that kurtz has left his cabin he has left the steamer and has returned to shore marlow goes ashore and finds kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station but not so weak as he can still call out to the natives marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in and when kurtz begins a threatening tone marlow interjects that his success in europe is assured in any case kurtz agrees to allow marlow to help him back to the steamer the next day they prepare for their departure they carried kurtz to the pilot house there was more air there the natives once again assembled on shore and the native woman returned they all began to shout marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore only the woman remained unmoved with outstretched arms the pilgrims opened fire the current was swift as they headed downstream kurtzs health was worsening marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill the steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made kurtz gives marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager while ill marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap unless i had the shakes too bad to stand he did not have much time for kurtz one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously i am lying here in the dark waiting for death the light was within a foot of his eyes i forced myself to murmur oh nonsense and stood over him as if transfixed as kurtz dies marlow hears him whisper in no more than a breath the horror the horror marlow blew out the candle and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims who were all in the mess room dining with the manager in a short while the managers boy appears and announces in a scathing tone mistah kurtz he dead next day marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury something in a muddy hole and then they very nearly buried me marlow falls very sick near death himself i have wrestled with death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine i was within a hairs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man he had something to say he said it since i had peeped over the edge myself i understand better he had summed up he had judged the horror he was a remarkable man after all this was the expression of some sort of belief it had candour it had conviction it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth the strange commingling of desire and hate he had made that last stride he had stepped over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible perhaps i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt better his cry much better upon marlows return to europe he seems embittered the everyday life of the europeans seem to be something a sham like some sort of hoax eventually marlow took care of the bundle of papers kurtz had entrusted to him to a clean shaven man who had an official manner marlow gave the paper entitled suppression of savage customs with the postscriptum torn off to another who claims to be kurtzs cousin marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance to a journalist he gave a report for publication if the journalist saw fit finally marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girls portrait kurtzs fianc e his intended at her door even before marlow entered her house memories of kurtz began to flow along with the final words that he whispered the girl came forward dressed in black and met marlow in a drawing room although it has been more than a year since kurtz died she was still in mourning it was late and the room was growing darker the final words of kurtzs seemed to echo in the room with the girl marlow envisioned them together i saw her and him in the same instant of time his death and her sorrow i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death she presses marlow for information ultimately asking him to repeat the final words kurtz had spoken being very uncomfortable marlow tells her that the final words that kurtz pronounce was her name marlow was surprised by her reaction i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain i knew it i was sure she knew she was sure i heard her weeping i wonder if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due hadnt he said he wanted only justice but i couldnt i could not tell her it would have been too dark too dark altogether then marlow and his listeners were silent our first narrator explains nobody moved for a time we have lost the first of the ebb said the director suddenly i raised my head the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
Heretics of Dune,Frank Herbert,much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the god emperor sandworms have reappeared on arrakis now called rakis and renewed the flow of the all important spice melange to the galaxy with letos death a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great scattering a new civilization has risen with three dominant powers the ixians whose no ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection the bene tleilax who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of face dancers and the bene gesserit a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities however people from the scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers the most powerful of these forces are the honored matres a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men on rakis a girl called sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms the bene gesserit intends to use a tleilaxu provided duncan idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider and the religious forces of mankind who they know will ultimately worship her the sisterhood have subtly been altering the gholas to bring their physical reflexes up to modern standards the bene gesserit leader mother superior taraza brings miles teg to guard the new idaho taraza also sends reverend mother darwi odrade to take command of the bene gesserit keep on rakis odrade is a loose cannon she

starts training sheeana as a bene gesserit at about the same time an attempt is made on the life of idaho but teg is able to defeat it teg flees with duncan and lucilla into the countryside in an ancient harkonnen no globe teg proceeds to awaken idahos original memories but does so before lucilla can imprint duncan and thus tie him to the sisterhood in the meantime taraza has been searching for teg and his party and finally establishes contact during the operation however teg and his companions are ambushed teg is captured while lucilla and duncan escape teg is tortured by a t probe but under pressure discovers a new ability he is able to speed up his physical and mental reactions which enables him to escape at the same time idaho is ambushed and taken hostage taraza arranges a meeting with the tleilaxu master waff who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the honored matres when pressed on the issue of idaho he also admits that the bene tleilax have conditioned

meet waff again on rakis he tries to assassinate taraza but odrade convinces him that the sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the bene tleilax taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the scattering this agreement causes consternation among the bene gesserit but odrade realizes that tarazas plan is to destroy rakis by destroying the planet the bene gesserit would be dependent on the tleilaxu for the spice ensuring an alliance lucilla arrives at a bene gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by honored matres who have idaho as their captive as lucilla infiltrates it the young honored matre murbella proceeds to seduce the captured idaho with the honored matre imprinting method however hidden tleilaxu conditioning kicks in

presence they print fake bills for an escaped slave and later they paint him up entirely in blue and call him the sick arab on one occasion they arrive in a town and advertise a three night engagement of a play which they call the royal nonesuch the play turns out to be only a couple of minutes of hysterical cavorting not worth anywhere near the cents the townsmen were charged to see it on the afternoon of the first performance a drunk called boggs arrives in town and makes a nuisance of himself by going around threatening a southern gentleman by the name of colonel sherburn sherburn comes out and warns boggs that he can continue threatening him up until exactly one oclock at one oclock boggs continues and colonel sherburn kills him somebody in the crowd whom sherburn later identifies as buck harkness cries out that sherburn should be lynched they all head up to colonel sherburns gate where they are met by sherburn who is standing on his porch carrying a loaded shotgun and his three legged dalmatian he causes them to back down by making a defiant speech telling them about the essential cowardice of southern justice the only lynching to be done here says sherburn will be in the dark by men wearing masks by the third night of the royal nonesuch the townspeople are ready to take their revenge but the duke and the king have already skipped town and together with huck and jim they continue down the river once they are far enough away the two grifters test the next town and decide to impersonate two brothers of peter wilks a recently deceased man of property using an absurd english accent the king manages to convince nearly all the townspeople that he is one of the brothers a preacher just arrived from england while the duke pretends to be a deaf mute to match accounts of the other brother one man in town is certain that they are a fraud and confronts them on the matter but the crowd refuses to support him afterwards the duke out of fear suggests to the king that they should cut and run the king boldly states his intention to continue to liquidate wilks estate saying haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town huck likes wilks daughters who treat him with kindness and courtesy so he tries to thwart the grifters plans by stealing back the inheritance money when he is in danger of being discovered he has to hide it in wilks coffin which is buried the next morning without huck knowing whether the money has been found or not the arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion when none of their signatures match the one on record the deaf mute brother who is said to do the correspondence has his arm in a sling and cannot currently write the townspeople devise a test which requires digging up the coffin to check when the money is found in wilks coffin the duke and the king are able to escape in the confusion they manage to rejoin huck and jim on the raft to hucks despair since he had thought he had escaped them after the four fugitives have drifted far enough from the town the king takes advantage of hucks temporary absence to sell his interest in the escaped slave jim for forty dollars outraged by this betrayal huck rejects the advice of his conscience which continues to tell him that in helping jim escape to freedom he is stealing miss watsons property accepting that all right then ill go to hell huck resolves to free jim jim is being held at the plantation of silas and sally phelps in a surprise twist they are revealed to be tom sawyers aunt and uncle since tom is expected for a visit huck is mistaken for tom he plays along hoping to find jims location and free him when huck intercepts tom on the road and tells him

time the townspeople are ready for them the duke and king are captured by the townspeople and are tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail rather than simply sneaking jim out of the shed where he is being held tom develops an elaborate plan to free him involving secret messages hidden tunnels a rope ladder sent in jims food and other elements from popular novels including a note to the phelps warning them of a gang planning to steal their runaway slave during the resulting pursuit tom is shot in the leg jim remains with him rather than completing his escape risking recapture huck has long known jim was white on the inside although the doctor admires jims decency he betrays him to a passing skiff and jim is captured while sleeping and returned to the phelps family after jims recapture events quickly resolve themselves toms aunt polly arrives and reveals huck and toms true identities tom announces that jim is a free man miss watson died two months earlier and freed jim in her will but tom chose not to reveal jims freedom so he could come up with an elaborate plan to rescue jim jim tells huck that hucks father has been dead for some time he was the dead man they

for this voyage hunting down and killing moby dick an old very large sperm whale with a snow white hump and mottled skin that crippled ahab on his last whaling voyage only starbuck shows any sign of resistance to the charismatic but monomaniacal captain the first mate argues repeatedly that the ship s purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil with luck returning home profitably safely and quickly but not to seek out and kill moby dick in particular nbsp and especially not for revenge eventually even starbuck acquiesces to ahabs will though harboring misgivings the mystery of the dark figures seen before the pequod set sail is explained during the voyages first lowering for whales ahab has secretly brought along his own boat crew including a mysterious harpooneer named fedallah

their twin deaths the novel describes numerous gams social meetings of two ships on the open sea crews normally visit each other during a gam captains on one vessel and chief mates on the other mail

widespread destruction including the disappearance of fedallah on the third day moby dick rises up to reveal fedallahs corpse tied to him by harpoon ropes even after the initial battle on the third day it is clear that while ahab is a vengeful whale hunter moby dick while dangerous and fearless is not motivated to hunt humans as he swims away from the pequod starbuck exhorts ahab one last time to desist observing that ahab ignores this voice of reason and continues with his ill fated chase as the three boats sail out to hunt him moby dick damages two of them forcing them to go back to the ship and leaving only ahabs vessel intact ahab harpoons the whale but the harpoon line breaks moby dick then rams the pequod itself which begins to sink as ahab harpoons the whale again the unfolding harpoon line catches him around his neck and he is dragged into the depths of the sea by the diving moby dick the boat is caught up in the whirlpool of the sinking ship which takes almost all the crew to their deaths only ishmael survives clinging to queequeg s coffin turned life buoy for an entire day and night before the rachel rescues him

the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate sense net a street gang named the panther moderns are hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on sense net the diversion allows molly to penetrate the building and steal dixies rom case and molly continue to investigate armitage discovering his former identity of colonel willis corto corto was a member of operation screaming fist which planned on infiltrating and disrupting soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over russia the russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible but the military went ahead with screaming fist with a new secret purpose of testing these russian defenses as the operation team attacked a soviet computer center emp weapons shut down their computers and flight systems and corto and his men were targeted by soviet laser defenses he and a few survivors commandeered a soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded finnish border everyone was killed except corto who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by finnish defense forces attacking as they were landing the helicopter corto after some months in hospital is visited by a government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realise was fake testimony designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the emp weapons after the trials corto snaps killing the government official who contacted him and then disappears into the criminal underworld in istanbul the team recruits peter riviera an artist thief and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants although riviera is a sociopath armitage coerces him into joining the team the trail leads case and molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named wintermute created by the plutocratic tessier ashpool family who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside villa straylight a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of freeside a cylindrical space habitat located at l and functioning primarily as a las vegas style space resort for the wealthy wintermutes nature is finally revealed it is one half of a super ai entity planned by the family although its exact purpose is unknown the turing law code governing ais bans the construction of such entities to get around this it had to be built as two separate ais wintermute was programmed by the tessier ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half neuromancer unable to achieve this merger on its own wintermute recruited armitage and his team to help complete the goal case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the turing imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program at the same time riviera is to obtain the password to the turing lock from lady jane marie france tessier ashpool an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of tessier ashpool sa wintermute believes riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her and that she will give him the password the password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the tessier ashpool home in villa straylight and entered simultaneously as case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace otherwise the turing lock will remain intact armitages team attracts the attention of the turing police whose job is to prevent ais from exceeding their built in limitations as molly and riviera gain entrance to villa straylight three officers arrest case and take him into custody wintermute manipulates the orbital casinos security and maintenance systems and kills the officers allowing case to escape the armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the corto personality as he relives screaming fist it is revealed that in the past wintermute had originally contacted corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence eventually convincing corto that he was armitage wintermute used him to persuade case and molly to help it merge with its twin ai neuromancer finally armitage becomes the shattered corto again but his newfound personality is short lived as he is killed by wintermute inside villa straylight molly is captured by riviera and lady jane worried about molly and operating under orders from wintermute case tracks her down with help from maelcum his rastafarian pilot neuromancer attempts to trap case within a cyber construct where he finds the consciousness of linda lee his girlfriend from chiba city who was murdered by one of cases underworld contacts case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay freeing himself case takes maelcum and confronts lady jane riviera and hideo lady janes ninja bodyguard riviera tries to kill case but lady jane is sympathetic towards case and molly and hideo protects him riviera blinds hideo but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight molly then explains to case that riviera is doomed anyway as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs which she had spiked with lady jane in possession of the password the team makes it to the computer terminal case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target lady jane is induced to give up her password and the lock is opened wintermute unites with neuromancer fusing into a greater entity the poison in cases bloodstream is washed out and he and molly are handsomely paid for their efforts while pauleys rom construct is apparently erased at his own request in the epilogue molly leaves case case finds a new girlfriend resumes his hacking work and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use wintermute neuromancer contacts him saying that it has become the sum total of the works the whole show and has begun looking for other ais like itself scanning old recorded transmissions from the s the super ai finds a lone ai transmitting from the alpha centauri star system in the matrix case hears inhuman laughter a trait associated with pauley during cases work with his rom construct thus suggesting that pauley was not erased after all but instead worked out a side deal with wintermute neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix in the end while logged into the matrix case catches a glimpse of himself his dead girlfriend linda lee and neuromancer the implication of the sighting is that neuromancer created a copy of cases consciousness when it previously tried to trap him the copy of cases consciousness now exists with that of lindas in the matrix where they are together forever
Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,the action takes place in two periods the second world war and the late s during the internet boom in lawrence pritchard waterhouse a young u s navy code breaker and mathematical genius is assigned to the newly formed joint british and american detachment this ultra secret units role is to hide the fact that allied intelligence has cracked the german enigma code the detachment stages events often behind enemy lines that provide alternative explanations for the allied intelligence successes marine sergeant bobby shaftoe a veteran of china and guadalcanal serves in unit carrying out waterhouses plans at the same time japanese soldiers including mining engineer goto dengo an old friend of shaftoes are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission circa randy waterhouse lawrences grandson joins his old dungeons and dragons companion avi halaby in a new startup providing pinoy grams to migrant filipinos via new fiber optic cables the aptly named epiphyte corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional sultanate of kinakuta vietnam veteran doug shaftoe and his daughter amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by goto furudenendu heir apparent to goto engineering complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge
No Logo,Naomi Klein,the book comprises four sections no space no choice no jobs and no logo the first three deal with the negative effects of brand oriented corporate activity while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back the book begins by tracing the history of brands klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding there is an actual clothing brand nologo which has existed since the late s and can be seen at www nologo com this is an excellent example of this shift to an anti brand brand early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory produced products these slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles according to klein in response to an economic crash in the s latin american debt crisis black monday savings and loan crisis japanese asset price bubble corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and began to target the youth demographic as opposed to the baby boomers who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment the book discusses how brand names such as nike or pepsi expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere as this happened the brands obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered cool along the way the brands attempted to have their names associated with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements klein argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products this theme recurs in the book and klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in third world countries in such industries as clothing footwear and computer hardware this section also looks at ways in which brands have muscled their presence into the school system and how in doing so they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and have used their position to gather information about the students klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers in the second section klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public whether through market dominance wal mart or through aggressive invasion of a region starbucks klein argues that the goal of each company is to become the dominant force in its respective field meanwhile other corporations such as sony or disney simply open their own chains of stores preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves this section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image abc news for instance is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of disney its parent company other chains such as wal mart often threaten to pull various products off of their shelves forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands this might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with wal marts image of family friendliness also discussed is the way that corporations abuse copyright laws in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand in this section the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries and particularly to places known as export processing zones such zones have no labor laws leading to dire working conditions the book then shifts back to north america where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits the term mcjob is introduced defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation inflexible or undesirable hours little chance of advancement and high levels of stress meanwhile the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits all of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector the result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for this resentment along with rising unemployment labour abuses abroad disregard for the environment and the ever increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations the final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the s these include adbusters magazine and the culture jamming movement as well as reclaim the streets and the mclibel trial less radical protests are also discussed such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to sweatshop labour klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship opting for the latter when i started this book she writes i honestly didnt know whether i was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad based movement but as time went on what i clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes
The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Philip K. Dick,the story begins in a future world where global warming has resulted in global temperatures so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours in a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on earth the un has initiated a draft for colonizing the nearby planets where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug can d in concert with layouts layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonist in their marginal off world colonies or even earth where global warming has progressed to the point that antarctica is prime vacation resort territory the illegal drug can d allows people to share their experience of the perky pat the name of the main female character in the simulated world layouts this sharing has caused a pseudo religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug up to the point where the novel begins new york city based perky pat or p p layouts inc has held a monopoly on this product as well as on the illegal trade in the drug can d which makes the shared hallucinations possible the novel opens shortly after barney mayerson p p layouts top precognitive someone who can glimpse future possibilities and sort out the most likely to actually occur has received a draft notice from the un for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on mars mayerson is sleeping with his assistant roni fugate but remains conflicted about the divorce which he himself initiated from his first wife emily a ceramic pot artist meanwhile emilys second husband tries to sell her pot designs to p p layouts as possible accessories for the perky pat virtual worlds but barney recognizing them as emilys rejects them out of spite meanwhile the un rescues palmer eldritchs ship from a crash on pluto leo bulero head of p p layouts and an evolved human meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a german doctor which are supposed to push the client forward on an evolutionary scale and which result in gross physical as well as mental modifications hears rumors that eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the prox system with similar properties to can d and that he plans to market it as chew z with u n approval on off world colonies however chew z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of chew z even more addictive than can d has been this would effectively destroy p p layouts bulero tries to contact eldritch but he is quarantined at a u n hospital both mayerson and fugate have precognitions of reports that bulero is going to be responsible for murdering eldritch meanwhile emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy unfortunately emily begins to devolve rather than evolving this devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older less sophisticated designs from earlier work without realizing it under the guise of a reporter bulero travels to eldritchs estate on the moon where eldritch holds a press conference bulero is kidnapped and forced to take chew z intravenously he enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and eldritch seemingly have some control after wrangling about business with eldritch bulero travels to what appears to be earth at some time in the not too distant future evolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of eldritch an enemy of the sol system bulero returns to earth and fires mayerson because mayerson was afraid to travel to the moon to rescue him mayerson in despair accepts his un conscription to mars but bulero recruits him as a double agent mayerson is to inject himself with a virus after taking chew z in a plot to deceive the un into thinking chew z is harmful and cause them to ban it on mars mayerson buys some chew z from eldritch who appears in holographic form mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with emily but finds that he does not control his hallucination like bulero he finds himself in the future mayerson arrives in new york two years hence where he speaks with bulero fugate and his future self about the death of palmer eldritch he also encounters several manifestations of eldritch identifiable by their robotic right hand artificial eyes and steel teeth eldritch offers to help mayerson become whatever he wants but in fact is so manipulative and controlling of the chew z alternate reality that mayerson ultimately decides hed rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by eldritch when a despairing mayerson chooses death he finds himself apparently forced into eldritchs body right at the point in the timeline where bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at eldritchs ship it appears that eldritchs plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in mayersons body while allowing mayerson himself to die in eldritchs place eldritch meanwhile intends to live on in mayersons form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a martian colonist mayerson stuck in eldritchs body and mistaken for him is indeed nearly killed by bulero in the near future but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his chew z trance in the present by bulero who has just arrived on mars bulero is willing to take mayerson back to earth but refuses to after learning that mayerson did not inject himself with the virus mayerson is now confident that bulero will kill eldritch so the sacrifice of taking the virus in order to ruin eldritchs business is unnecessary but he does not try to convince bulero of this later mayerson discusses his experience with a neo christian colonist and they conclude that either eldritch became a god in the prox system or some god like being has taken his place mayerson is convinced some aspect of eldritch is still inside him and that as long as he refuses to take chew z again it is eldritch who will actually be killed by bulero in the near future mayerson is half resigned half hopeful about taking on the life of a martian colonist without reprieve mayerson considers the possibility of eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god but inimical or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god the novel has an ambiguous ending with bulero heading back toward earth and apparent proliferation of eldritchs cyborg bodily stigmata which may mean that bulero is still trapped in eldritchs hallucinatory domain or that chew z is becoming increasingly popular amongst terrans and martian colonists

Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead,Tom Stoppard,the play opens with rosencrantz and guildenstern betting on coin flips rosencrantz who bets heads each time wins ninety two flips in a row the extreme unlikeliness of this event according to the laws of probability leads guildenstern to suggest that they may be within un sub or supernatural forces the reader learns why they are where they are the king has sent for them guildenstern theorizes on the nature of reality focusing on how an event becomes increasingly real as more people witness it a troupe of tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show they seem capable only of performances involving bloodbaths the next two scenes are from the plot of hamlet the first involving hamlet and ophelia takes place off stage in the shakespeare the second is taken directly from hamlet and is rosencrantz and guildensterns first appearance in that play here the danish king and queen claudius and gertrude ask the two to discover the nature of hamlets recent madness the royal couple demonstrate an inability to distinguish the two courtiers from one another as indeed do the characters themselves to their irritation rosencrantz and guildenstern attempt to practice for their meeting with the prince by one pretending to be hamlet and the other asking him questions but they glean no new information from it the act closes with another scene from hamlet in which they finally meet the prince face to face the act opens with the end of the conversation between rosencrantz guildenstern and hamlet guildenstern tries to look on the bright side while rosencrantz makes it clear that the pair had made no progress that hamlet had entirely outwitted them the player returns to the stage he is angry that the pair had not earlier stayed to watch their play because without an audience his tragedians are nothing he tells them to stop questioning their existence because upon examination life appears too chaotic to comprehend the player rosencrantz and guildenstern lose themselves in yet another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language the player leaves in order to prepare for his production of the murder of gonzago set to be put on in front of hamlet and the king and queen the royal couple enters and begins another short scene taken directly from hamlet they ask about the duos encounter with the prince and rosencrantz and guildenstern inform them about his interest in the tragedians production after the king and queen leave the partners contemplate their job they see hamlet walk by but fail to seize the opportunity to interview him the tragedians return and perform their dress rehearsal of the murder of gonzago the play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in hamlet characters resembling rosencrantz and guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of english courtiers foreshadowing their true fate rosencrantz does not quite make the connection but guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the tragedians inability to capture the real essence of death the stage becomes dark when the stage is once again visible rosencrantz and guildenstern lie in the same position as had the actors portraying their deaths the partners are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple claudius enters again and tells them to find where hamlet has hidden polonius corpse after many false starts they eventually find hamlet who leaves with the king rosencrantz is delighted to find that his mission is complete but guildenstern knows it is not over hamlet enters speaking with a norwegian soldier rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany hamlet to england because it means freedom from the orders of the danish court guildenstern understands that wherever they go they are still trapped in this world rosencrantz and guildenstern find themselves on a ship that has already set sail the audience is led to believe that the pair has no knowledge of how they got there at first they try to determine whether they are still alive eventually they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat they remember that claudius had given them a letter to deliver to england after some brief confusion over who actually has the letter they find it and end up opening it they realize that claudius has asked for hamlet to be killed while rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings the stage becomes black and presumably the characters go to sleep hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself an act which takes place off stage in hamlet the pair discovers that the tragedians are hidden impossibly according to the stage directions in several barrels on deck they are fleeing denmark because their play has offended claudius when rosencrantz complains that there is not enough action pirates attack hamlet rosencrantz and guildenstern and the player all hide in separate barrels the lights dim when the lights come on again hamlet has vanished in hamlet its reported that he was kidnapped by pirates from the ship rosencrantz and guildenstern panic and re read the letter to find that it now calls for them to be put to death instead of the prince guildenstern cannot understand why he and rosencrantz are so important as to necessitate their executions the player tells guildenstern that all paths end in death guildenstern snaps and draws the players dagger from his belt shouting at him that his portrayals of death do not do justice to the real thing he stabs the player and the player appears to die guildenstern honestly believes he has killed the player seconds later the tragedians begin to clap and the player stands up and brushes himself off revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade the tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of hamlet the lighting shifts so that rosencrantz and guildenstern are the only ones visible rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die still he resigns himself to his fate and his character disappears guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he could have stopped the series of events that has brought him to this point he disappears as well the final scene features the last few lines from shakespeares hamlet the ambassador from england announces that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
Ringworld,Larry Niven,the novel opens in louis gridley wu is celebrating his th birthday despite his age louis is in perfect physical condition but is bored he has experienced life thoroughly and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of known space all alone in a spaceship for a year or more he is confronted by nessus a piersons puppeteer and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond known space speaker to animals speaker who is a kzin and teela brown a young human woman also join the voyage they first travel to the puppeteer home world where they learn that the expeditions goal is to explore a ringworld an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of earths orbit which makes it about million miles in circumference encircling a sol type star it rotates providing artificial gravity that is as strong as earths gravity through the action of centrifugal force the ringworld has a habitable flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million earth sized planets night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin ultra strong wire shadow square wire none of the crews attempts at contacting the ringworld succeed and their ship is disabled by its automated meteor defense system the severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow square wire and crash lands on the ringworld near a huge mountain the ships defences keep the crew compartment and many of the ships systems intact including the faster than light drive hyperdrive but the normal drive is destroyed leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive the team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space as well as fulfilling their original mission learning more about the ringworld using their flycycles they try to reach the rim of the ring where they hope to find some technology that will help them it will take them months to cross the vast distance when teela develops plateau trance they find themselves forced to land on the ground they encounter apparently human ringworld natives the natives who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city think that the crew are the engineers of the ring whom they revere as gods the crew is attacked when they commit a blasphemy they continue their journey during which nessus is forced to reveal some puppeteer secrets they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans breeding for luck and kzin breeding for less aggressiveness the resulting hostility forces nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance they encounter a city and in a floating building they find a map of the ringworld and videos of its past civilization in a giant storm caused by air escaping through a hole in the ring floor due to meteor impact teela is blown away in an unknown direction while searching for her in a ruined city louis and speakers flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders they are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station nessus arrives entering the station to help his team in the station they meet halrloprillalar hotrufan prill a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the ringworld and other inhabited worlds her spaceship was stranded on the ringworld when the landing mechanism failed she relates what she learned of the downfall of the ringworlds civilization a mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship without its superconductive technology civilization fell teela reaches the police station accompanied by her new lover a native hero called seeker who helped her survive based on his studies of an ancient ringworld map louis devises a plan to escape the four explorers with seeker and prill use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers crashed ship along the way teela and seeker choose to remain behind to inhabit a flying castle and remain on ringworld the remaining explorers and prill collect one end of the shadow square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed dragging the wire behind them as they travel reaching the wreck louis threads the shadow wire through the crashed ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station and then continues to pull the wire onward up to the summit of fist of god the enormous mountain near their crash site the massive mountain does not appear on a map of the original ringworld leading louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteor impact with the underside of the ring which pushed the mountain up from the ring floor and broke through the top of the mountain above the edge of the rings atmosphere is therefore a passage to the underside of the ringworld and freedom louis drives the police station over the edge of the crater because the ringworld spins fast enough to provide gravity once the police station and ship are on the underside centrifugal force pushes them outward from the ring into open space the crew can then use the ships faster than light drive to get home the book concludes with louis and speaker discussing returning to the ringworld
Rendezvous with Rama,Arthur C. Clarke,after a major disaster caused by a meteorite falling in eastern italy in the government of earth sets up the spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space the rama of the title is an alien star ship initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as it is detected by astronomers in the year while still outside the orbit of jupiter the objects speed nbsp nbsp km h and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate that this is not an object on a long orbit around our sun it comes from interstellar space astronomers interest is further piqued when they realise that this asteroid not only has an extremely rapid rotation period of minutes but it is exceptionally large it is subsequently renamed rama after the hindu god and an unmanned space probe dubbed sita is launched from the mars moon phobos to intercept and photograph the object the resulting images taken during its rapid flyby reveal that rama is a perfect cylinder in diameter and long made of a completely featureless material making this humankinds first encounter with an alien space ship the manned solar survey vessel endeavour is sent to study rama as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period rama will spend in our solar system endeavour manages to rendezvous with rama one month after the space ship first comes to earths attention when the giant alien spacecraft is already within venus orbit the crew led by commander bill norton enters rama through triple airlocks and explores the vast km wide by km long cylindrical world of its interior but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remains enigmatic throughout the book inside rama the air is discovered to be breathable the astronauts discover several features including cities odd blocky shapes that look like buildings and streets with shallow trenches in them looking like trolley car tracks that actually served as factories a sea that stretches in a band around rama dubbed the cylindrical sea and seven massive cones at the southern end of rama believed to form part of the propulsion system one of the crew members jimmy pak who has experience with low gravity skybikes volunteers to ride a smuggled skybike along ramas axis to the far end otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the m high cliff on the opposite shore a few hours later jimmy reaches the massive metal cones on the southern end of rama picking up a strange magnetic field coming from the cones pak takes a few pictures of the area and the strange plateau on the southern end of ramas landmass before leaving the electrical charge in the atmosphere begins to increase during paks return resulting in lightning a discharge hits his skybike causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent when pak wakes up he sees a crab like creature picking up his skybike and chopping it into pieces he cannot decide whether it is a robot or a biological alien and keeps his distance while contacting norton and the others on the other side of rama for help norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea using a small improvised craft and pak waits he sees the crab like creature dump the remains of the skybike into the sea and he approaches the creature but it completely ignores him pak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea amongst the strange geometric patterns he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research pak jumps off the m cliff his descent slowed by low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute and swims quickly to the craft the ride back is highlighted by tidal waves in the cylindrical sea formed by movements of rama itself as it makes course corrections when the crew arrive at base they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp when one is found damaged and apparently lifeless the teams doctor biologist surgeon commander laura ernst inspects it and names it a biot or a hybrid of a biological entity and robot she concludes that it and others appear to be electrically powered by natural internal batteries much like terrestrial electric eels and possess some degree of intelligence they are believed to be the servants of ramas still absent builders and maintainers of the starship the members of the rama committee and the united planets both based on the moon have been monitoring events inside rama and giving feedback the hermian colonists have concluded that rama is a potential threat to them and send a rocket mounted bomb to destroy rama it is successfully defused by lt boris rodrigo using a pair of wire cutters as rama approaches perihelion the biots act strangely jumping into the cylindrical sea where they are destroyed by aquatic biots sharks and absorbed back into the mineral laden water on one last expedition to explore rama a few crew members decide to visit the city london chosen as closest to the stairways at the northern end of the cylinder they use to return to their ship to use a laser to cut open one of the buildings and see what is inside inside they discover pedestals containing holograms of various artifacts believed to have been used by the ramans as tools and other objects the holograms themselves are presumed to be templates for replicating these items as needed the most amazing sight is what appears to be a uniform with bandoliers straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the ramans but before the crew can photograph any more holograms the lights start going out and they must leave they all exit up through the stairway on ramas northern side out of the three airlocks and board endeavour when endeavour is a safe distance away and rama reaches perihelion rama harnesses the suns gravitational field with its mysterious space drive for use in a slingshot manoeuvre and is flung out of the solar system toward an unknown location in the direction of the large magellanic cloud the book was meant to stand alone although the final sentence of the book suggests otherwise clarke however denied that this sentence was meant to hint at a continuation of the story according to his foreword in the books sequel it was just a good way to end the book and was added during a final revision

Speaker for the Dead,Orson Scott Card,on novinhas request for a speaker andrew wiggin leaves for lusitania a colony turned into a virtual prison with its expansion severely limited and its whole existence devoted to the work of xenologers who study the pequeninos the first sentient beings found since the destruction of formics lusitania itself is remarkably lacking in biodiversity featuring thousands of unfilled ecological niches the other outstanding feature of lusitania is the descolada a native virus which almost wipes out the colony until husband and wife biologists gusta and cida succeed in developing counters unfortunately they didnt find the cure soon enough to save themselves leaving orphaned daughter novinha to strike out for herself at the age of thirteen novinha a cold and distant girl successfully petitions to be made the official biologist of the colony roughly the equivalent of a masters degree from then on she contributes to the work of father and son xenologers alien anthropology pipo and libo and for a short time there is family and camaraderie one day however she makes a discovery about the descolada that its in every native lifeform and pipo rushes out to talk to the piggies about the discovery without telling her or libo why its important they cant figure it out on their own and never learn a few hours later pipo is found vivisected in the grass his corpse does not even have the benefit of a tree the symbol of honor placed among all dead piggies novinha erases all the lab work but cannot delete the information itself due to regulations libo demands to see it but even their love for each other will not make her let him see it it appears to be a secret the piggies will kill to keep now novinha is determined to ensure they never marry the way they always planned to for if they do libo will have access to those locked files and novinha fears will share the same fate as his father in anguish novinha calls for a speaker for the dead hoping beyond hope that perhaps the original speaker may arrive to make sense of pipos death and maybe of her life andrew wiggin doesnt dare let himself be known as ender anymore the name is now an epithet ender decides to leave his sister valentine behind she is married and pregnant after traveling with her for many years he leaves as soon as possible with his only companion being jane an artificial sentience existing within the ansible computer network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances he arrives on lusitania after twenty two years in transit only around two weeks to him to discover that novinha has canceled her call or rather tried to as a call for a speaker cannot legally be canceled after the speaker has begun the journey however two others have called making enders trip not entirely in vain they are novinhas eldest son miro calling for someone to speak the death of libo who was killed the same way his father was and novinhas eldest daughter ela calling for someone to speak the death of novinhas husband marcos ribeira who died not six weeks ago from a terminal disease besides attempting to unravel the question of why novinha married marc o when she really loved libo marc o was sterile and a quick genetic scan on janes part reveals that novinhas children are all in fact libos ender also takes responsibility for attempting to heal the ribeira family and manages to adopt or perhaps is adopted by most of the children within their first meeting he also takes a strong interest in the pequeninos and eventually in direct violation of starways congress law meets with them in person the hive queen has also managed to make contact with the pequeninos philotically and has told them a number of things mdash including the fact that andrew wiggin is not only the original speaker for the dead but the original xenocide as well which romantically involved zenadors a shortened form of the word xenologists miro and ouanda do not believe the hive queen very emphatically wants to be revived and freed on lusitania finally in an effort to help ender jane deliberately reveals to starways congress that miro and ouanda continuing the legacy of ouandas dead father libo have been deliberately introducing new technology into the piggy lifestyle both zenadors are called away to the nearest world for trial a journey that would take twenty two years the colonys charter is revoked and all humans are ordered to evacuate posthaste leaving no sign of ever having been there ender holds a public speaking for marc o novinhas late husband however ender cannot but help reveal secrets from the lives of libo pipo and even novinha herself as their lives were all so delicately bound together by guilt deception and love the speaker explains how novinha blames herself for pipos death and underwent a life of suffering and deception marrying marc o so that to prevent libo from accessing the information which killed pipo but secretly trysting with libo because their love for each other never truly died the meaning of pipos and libos murders come out as well the trees are the third stage in the life of the piggies trees grown from piggies killed normally become brothertrees but the ritually dissected ones are done so in order to make them fathertrees sentient living trees that are unlike animal pequeninos capable of reproduction the descolada is proved to be instrumental in these transformations finally the speaker for the dead is able to work out a treaty with the piggies so that humans and pequeninos might live in peace unfortunately it is not without cost miro distraught to learn that ouanda his girlfriend in secret is actually his sister attempts to cross the fence which separates the humans from the piggies and suffers significant neurological damage with no other way to save him the colony declares itself in rebellion jane shuts off outside ansible contact miro is rescued and ender enters the forest to negotiate the aforementioned treaty he signs it ender wiggin and for the first time in his life someone novinha is prepared to receive the xenocide with compassion instead of revulsion valentine and her family plan to come to lusitania to help out in the rebellion aided by jane miro with his crippled body is sent into space to meet them the hive queen is released ready to begin the continuation of her species and ender marries novinha

planet destroy their targets and retreat suffering a single casualty in the process dizzy flores who dies in the retrieval boat of wounds received in action the story then flashes back to ricos graduation from high school and his decision to sign up for federal service over the objections of his father who disowns him this is the only chapter that describes ricos civilian life and most of it

federation some see dubois as speaking for heinlein throughout the novel he delivers what is probably the books most famous soliloquy on violence it has settled more issues in history than has any other factor fleet sergeant hos monologues examine the nature of military service and his anti military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with dubois we learn later that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to ricos high school history and moral philosophy course which describe how in the terran federation of ricos day the rights of a full citizen to vote and hold public office must be earned through some form of volunteer federal service those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this federal service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy free speech assembly etc but they cannot vote or hold public office this structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the th century western democracies brought on by both social failures at home among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency and military defeat by the chinese hegemony overseas in the next section of the novel after being denied all his higher preferred service choices rico goes to boot camp at camp arthur currie on the northern prairies five chapters are spent exploring ricos experience there including his adjustment to a very different situation entering the service under the training of the leading instructor career ships sergeant charles zim camp currie is rigorous by design less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training the rest either resign are expelled or die in training one of the chapters deals with ted hendrick a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a simulated combat exercise he caught sgt zim by surprise after being struck by the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise another recruit a deserter who murdered a baby girl while awol is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police and return to camp

during ricos training the bug war has changed from border incidents to formal war and rico finds himself taking part in combat operations the war officially starts with an arachnid attack that annihilates the city of buenos aires which kills juans mother who was visiting there although rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there had been many incidents patrols or police actions rico briefly describes the terran federations loss at the battle of klendathu during which his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed following klendathu the terran federation is reduced to making hit and run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel which chronologically would be placed between chapters and rico meanwhile finds himself posted to rasczaks roughnecks this part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life as well as the relationship between officers and non commissioned officers personified in this case by rasczak and sergeant jelal eventually rico decides to become a career soldier and one of his fellow troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for officer candidate school he applies and is accepted it turns out to be just like boot camp only squared and cubed with books added rico manages to make it through to the final exam in the fleet he is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his field test and commands his own unit during operation royalty it is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor sergeant zim although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men he passes the final exam and graduates as a second lieutenant there is also an account of the meeting between rico and his father who volunteered for service after his wife ricos mother was killed at buenos aires the final chapter serves as more of a coda depicting rico aboard the rodger young as the lieutenant in command of ricos

The Doors of Perception,Aldous Huxley,after a brief overview of research into mescaline huxley recounts that he was given of a gram at am one day in may huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly colored visionary landscapes when he only sees lights and shapes he puts this down to being a bad visualiser however he experiences a great change in his perception of the external world by pm a vase of flowers becomes the miracle moment by moment of naked existence the experience he asserts is neither agreeable nor disagreeable but simply is he likens it to meister eckhart s istigheit or is ness and plato s being but not separated from becoming he feels he understands the hindu concept of satchitananda as well as the zen koan that the dharma body of the buddha is in the hedge and buddhist suchness in this state huxley explains he didn t have an i but instead a not i meaning and existence pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time duration is replaced by a perpetual present reflecting on the experience afterwards huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher c d broad that to enable us to live the brain and nervous system eliminate unessential information from the totality of the mind at large in summary huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of mescaline visual impressions are intensified and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating temporarily leaving the chronological flow he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the world s biggest drug store wbds where he was presented with books on art in one book the dress in botticelli s judith provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art to create mood and also to represent the mystery of pure being huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people c zanne s self portrait with a straw hat seems to him as incredibly pretentious while vermeer s human still lives also the le nain brothers and vuillard are the nearest to reflecting this not self state for huxley the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life known as the way of martha and the way of mary as huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height but not its fullness correct behaviour and alertness are needed nonetheless huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world after listening to mozart s c minor piano concerto gesualdo s madrigals and alban berg s lyric suite huxley heads into the garden outside the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed this gives him an insight into madness he reflects that spiritual literature including the works of jacob boehme william law and the tibetan book of the dead talk of these pains and terrors huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential after lunch and the drive to the wbds he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind his final insight is taken from buddhist scripture that within sameness there is difference although that difference is not different from sameness the book finishes with huxley s final reflections on the meaning of his experience firstly the urge to transcend one s self is universal through times and cultures and was characterized by h g wells as the door in the wall he reasons that better healthier doors are needed than alcohol and tobacco mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions ideally self transcendence would be found in religion but huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen christianity and mescaline seem well suited for each other the native american church for instance uses the drug as a sacrament where its use combines religious feeling with decorum huxley concludes that mescaline is not enlightenment or the beatific vision but a gratuitous grace a term taken from st thomas aquinas summa theologica it is not necessary but helpful especially so for the intellectual who can become the victim of words and symbols although systematic reasoning is important direct perception has intrinsic value too finally huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better
The Time Machine,H. G. Wells,the books protagonist is an english scientist and gentleman inventor living in richmond surrey identified by a narrator simply as the time traveller the narrator recounts the travellers lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it he reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale becoming the new narrator in the new narrative the time traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to a d where he meets the eloi a society of small elegant childlike adults they live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings doing no work and having a frugivorous diet his efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline and he speculates that they are a peaceful communist society the result of humanity conquering nature with technology and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival returning to the site where he arrived the time traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors locked from the inside which resembles a sphinx later in the dark he is approached menacingly by the morlocks ape like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above ground paradise possible he alters his theory speculating that the human race has evolved into two species the leisured classes have become the ineffectual eloi and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutish light fearing morlocks deducing that the morlocks have taken his time machine he explores the morlock tunnels learning that they feed on the eloi his revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers the time traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger with no real challenges facing either species they have both lost the spirit intelligence and physical fitness of man at its peak meanwhile he saves an eloi named weena from drowning as none of the other eloi take any notice of her plight and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days he takes weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against morlocks whom he fears he must fight to get back his machine he plans to take weena back to his own time because the long and tiring journey back to weenas home is too much for them they stop in the forest and they are then overcome by morlocks in the night and weena faints the traveller escapes only when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire weena is presumably lost in the fire as are the morlocks the morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the traveller not understanding that he will use it to escape he travels further ahead to roughly million years from his own time there he sees some of the last living things on a dying earth menacing reddish crab like creatures slowly wandering the blood red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation he continues to make short jumps through time seeing earths rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger redder and dimmer and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out overwhelmed he returns to his laboratory arriving just three hours after he originally left interrupting dinner he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors producing as evidence two strange flowers weena had put in his pocket the original narrator takes over and relates that he returned to the time travellers house the next day finding him in final preparations for another journey the traveller promises to return in half an hour but three years later the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him
The Shockwave Rider,John Brunner,the novel is set in the weeks following nicks recapture after several years on the run alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator who is trying to discover why the programs star pupil had absconded and flashbacks of his career the interrogator is paul freeman a graduate of another secret installation known as electric skillet which focuses on weapons and defense strategy although he initially felt at home at tarnover nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there these produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study at this point nick becomes determined to escape he studies data processing steals a personal id code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance and goes on the run he uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself easily adopting entire new personas one is the pastor of a popular church another is an idle playboy gigolo in this last role calling himself sandy locke he becomes the lover of ina grierson a top executive at ground to space industries a powerful hypercorp known to all as g s intending to use the computer facilities at g s to ensure that his code is still valid after the six years he has been away he signs on as a systems rationalizer with the company this brings him into contact with inas daughter kate who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle at the age of nicks age when he left tarnover kate is a perpetual student at umkc she is perceptive enough to penetrate nicks adopted persona deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him he visits her at home helping her to clean out some of her possessions and meeting her tame cougar bagheera bagheera is the product of her late fathers genetic research into intelligence he died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses the st century lifestyle produces a symptom called overload in many people and most including nick take tranquilizers to some degree however nick collapses completely when told that a representative from tarnover is coming to meet him at g s he returns to kate and confesses that he is not what he seems asking for her help she conducts him to one of the paid avoidance areas in california where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake after nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places they move to the least known one a town called precipice precipice turns out to be a utopian community of a few thousand people the nearest comparison would be an agrarian cottage industry community designed by william morris precipice is also the home of hearing aid an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country hearing aid is also known as the ten nines after the phone number used to call it people call the service and simply talk some rant others seek sympathy still others commit suicide while on the phone hearing aids promise is that nobody else not even the government will hear the call the only response hearing aid gives to a caller is only i heard that i hope it helped nick and kate settle into the community the inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that kates father worked on these act as companions guards nannies and even lie detectors using their sense of smell nick rewrites the computer tapeworm that prevents the calls to hearing aid being monitored while at g s he became aware of massive backups of data being performed clearly in anticipation of a major network outage the hearing aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked but nick realizes that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them his new worm which he calls a phage cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network possibly encouraged by the government local gangs and tribes raid precipice burning down nick and kates house before being overwhelmed by the dogs nick suffering another overload blames kate for the incident since she following hearing aid policy cut off a call from someone attempting to warn precipice he hits her and then filled with remorse leaves the town he finally reveals his location to the authorities when encountering one of the roman circus operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country he responds to an all comers challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience at tarnover paul freeman takes charge of the interrogation he was the representative whom nick as sandy locke was supposed to meet at g s freeman a tall gaunt african american gradually comes to realize that he has more sympathy with nicks views than his employers and eventually absconds himself giving nick computer access so that nick can make his own escape the precipitating event in this case is kates abduction by government agents who bring her to tarnover for further questioning and to threaten nick with the code he gets from freeman he sets up an identity as an army major with kate as his prisoner once clear of tarnover they disappear together this time around nick has another plan and rather than running and hiding he and kate spend a number of months traveling the country aided by an invisible college of academics who are allies or former residents of precipice he creates a new worm which is designed to destroy all secrecy brunner invented the term worm for this program as a self replicating program that propagates across a computer network the term worm was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program the worm is eventually activated and the details of all the governments dark secrets clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children bribes and kickbacks from corporations concealed crimes of high public officials now become accessible from anywhere on the network in fact those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details in place of the old system nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism with peoples worth being defined by their roles in society not their connections in high places in effect the network becomes the entire government and financial system policing income for illegal money freezing the accounts of criminals while making sure money or credit flows to places where people are in need this will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite again conducted over the network allow it in a final atavistic attempt at revenge the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local air force base warned by hearing aid nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town the book

The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,sir charles baskerville is found lying dead on the grounds of his country house baskerville hall the cause is ascribed to a heart attack fearing for the safety of sir charless nephew and only known heir sir henry baskerville coming from america to claim his inheritance dr james mortimer travels to london and asks sherlock holmes for help mortimer explains that the baskerville family is afflicted by a curse according to an old account over two centuries ago hugo baskerville was infatuated with a farmers daughter he kidnapped her and imprisoned her in his bedroom she escaped and the furious baskerville offered his soul to the devil if he could recapture her aided by friends he pursued the girl onto the desolate moor baskerville and his victim were found dead she had died from fright but a giant spectral hound stood guard over baskervilles body the hound tore out baskervilles throat then vanished into the night sir charles baskerville had become fearful of the legendary curse and its hellhound mortimer decided that sir charles had been waiting for someone when he died his face was contorted in a ghastly expression while his footprints suggested he was running from something the elderly mans heart was not strong and he had planned to go to london the next day mortimer says he had seen the footprints of a gigantic hound near sir charless body something not revealed at the inquest intrigued by the case holmes meets with sir henry newly arrived from america sir henry is puzzled by an anonymous note delivered to his london hotel room warning him to avoid the devon moors holmes says that the note had been composed largely of letters cut from the times probably in a hotel judging by other clues the fact that the letters were cut with nail scissors suggested an authoress as did a remnant whiff of perfume holmes keeps this last detail to himself when holmes and watson later join sir henry at his hotel they learn one of the baronets new boots has gone missing no good explanation can be found for the loss holmes asks if there were any other living relatives besides sir henry mortimer tells him that charles had two brothers rodger and john sir henry is the sole child of john who settled in america and raised his son there another brother rodger was known to be the black sheep of the family a wastrel and inveterate gambler he fled to south america to avoid creditors he is believed to have died there alone despite the notes warning sir henry insists on visiting baskerville hall as sir henry leaves holmes baker street apartment holmes and doctor watson follow him they realise that a man with a fake looking black beard in a cab is also following him holmes and watson pursue this man but he escapes however holmes memorises the cab number holmes stops in at a messenger office and employs a young boy cartwright to go visit londons hotels and look through wastepaper in search of cut up copies of the times by the time they return to the hotel sir henry has had another newer boot stolen when the first missing boot is discovered before the meeting is over holmes begins to realise they must be dealing with a real hound hence the emphasis on the scent of the used boot when conversation turns to the man in the cab mortimer says that barrymore the servant at baskerville hall has a beard and a telegram is sent to check on his whereabouts it is decided that with holmes being tied up in london with other cases watson will accompany sir henry to baskerville hall and report back by telegram in detail later that evening telegrams from cartwright who was unable to find the newspaper and baskerville hall where barrymore apparently is bring an end to those leads a visit from john clayton who was driving the cab with the black bearded man is of little help he says that the man had identified himself as holmes much to the surprise and amusement of the actual holmes mortimer watson and sir henry set off for baskerville hall the following saturday the baronet is excited to see it and his connection with the land is clear but finds the moor dampened soldiers are about the area on the lookout for an escaped murderer named selden barrymore and his wife wish to depart baskerville hall as soon as is convenient and the hall is in general a somber place watson has trouble sleeping that night and hears a woman crying the next morning barrymore denies that it was his wife who is one of only two women in the house watson sees mrs barrymore later in the morning however and observes clear evidence that she has indeed been weeping watson checks with the postmaster in coombe tracey and learns that the telegram was not actually delivered into the hands of barrymore so it is no longer certain that he was at the hall and not in london on his way back watson meets jack stapleton a naturalist familiar with the moor even though he has only been in the area for two years they hear a moan that the peasants attribute to the hound but stapleton attributes it to the cry of a bittern or possibly the bog settling he then runs off after a specimen of the butterfly cyclopedes which was still found on dartmoor until the s watson is not alone for long before beryl stapleton jacks sister approaches him mistaking him for sir henry she urgently warns him to leave the area but drops the subject when her brother returns the three walk to merripit house the stapletons home and during the discussion watson learns that stapleton used to run a school in yorkshire though he is offered lunch and a look at stapleton s collections watson departs for the hall before he gets far along the path miss stapleton overtakes him and retracts her warning watson notices that the brother and sister dont look very much alike sir henry soon meets miss stapleton and becomes romantically interested despite her brother s intrusions watson meets another neighbour mr frankland an elderly lawyer barrymore draws increasing suspicion as watson and sir henry see him late at night walk with a candle into an empty room hold it up to the window and then leave realising that the room has a view out on the moor watson and sir henry determine to figure out what is going on barrymores wife confesses that her brother is selden the escaped murderer and that she was giving him food while he was out on the moor meanwhile during the day sir henry continues to pursue beryl stapleton until her brother runs up on them and yells angrily he later explains to the disappointed baronet that it was not personal he was just afraid of losing his only companion so quickly to show there are no hard feelings he invites sir henry to dine with him and his sister on friday sir henry then becomes the person doing the surprising when he and watson walk in on barrymore catching him at night in the room with a candle barrymore refuses to answer their questions since it is not his secret to tell but mrs barrymore s she tells them that the runaway convict selden is her brother and the candle is a signal to him that food has been left for him when the couple return to their room sir henry and watson go off to find the convict despite the poor weather and frightening sound of the hound they see selden by another candle but are unable to catch him watson notices the outlined figure of another man standing on top of a tor with the moon behind him but he likewise gets away barrymore is upset when he finds out that they tried to capture selden but when an agreement is reached to allow selden to flee the country he is willing to repay the favour he tells them of finding a mostly burnt letter asking sir charles to be at the gate at the time of his death it was signed with the initials l l mortimer tells watson the next day those initials could stand for laura lyons frankland s daughter she lives in coombe tracey when watson goes to talk to her she admits to writing the letter in hopes that sir charles would be willing to help finance her divorce but says she never kept the appointment frankland has just won two law cases and invites watson in to help him celebrate barrymore had previously told watson that another man lived out on the moor besides selden and frankland unwittingly confirms this when he shows watson through his telescope the figure of a boy carrying food watson departs the house and goes in that direction he finds the prehistoric stone dwelling where the unknown man has been staying goes in and sees a message reporting on his own activities he waits revolver at the ready for the unknown man to return the unknown man proves to be holmes he has kept his location a secret so that watson would not be tempted to come out and so he would be able to appear on the scene of action at the critical moment watson s reports have been of much help to him and he then tells his friend some of the information he has uncoveredstapleton is actually married to the woman passing as miss stapleton and was also promising marriage to laura lyons to get her cooperation as they bring their conversation to an end they hear a ghastly scream they run towards the sound and finding a body mistake it for sir henry they realise it is actually the escaped convict selden the brother of mrs barrymore dressed in the baronet s old clothes which had been given to barrymore by way of further apology for distrusting him then stapleton appears and while he makes excuses for his presence holmes announces that he will return to london the next day his investigations having produced no result holmes and watson return to baskerville hall where over dinner the detective stares at hugo baskervilles portrait calling watson over after dinner he covers the hair to show the face revealing its striking likeness to stapleton this provides the motive in the crimewith sir henry gone stapleton could lay claim to the baskerville fortune being clearly a baskerville himself when they return to mrs lyons s apartment holmes questioning forces her to admit stapleton s role in the letter that lured sir charles to his death they go to the railway station to meet det inspector lestrade whom holmes has called in by telegram under the threat of advancing fog watson holmes and lestrade lie in wait outside merripit house where sir henry has been dining when the baronet leaves and sets off across the moor stapleton looses the hound holmes and watson manage to shoot it before it can hurt sir henry seriously and discover that its hellish appearance was acquired by means of phosphorus they find mrs stapleton bound and gagged in an upstairs room of merripit house when she is freed she tells them of stapleton s hideout an island deep in the great grimpen mire they look for him next day unsuccessfully and he is presumed dead having lost his footing and being sucked down into the foul and bottomless depths of the mire holmes and watson are only able to find and recover sir henrys boot used by stapleton to give the hound sir henrys scent and find the remains of dr mortimers dog in the mire some weeks later watson questions holmes about the baskerville case holmes reveals that although believed to have died unmarried sir charles younger brother rodger baskerville had married and had a son with the same name as his father the son john rodger baskerville after embezzling public money in costa rica took the name vandeleur and fled to england where he used the money to fund a yorkshire school unfortunately for him the tutor he had hired died of consumption and after an epidemic of the disease killed three students the school itself failed now using the name stapleton baskerville vandeleur fled with his wife to dartmoor he apparently supported himself by burglary engaging in four large robberies and pistolling a page who surprised him having learned the story of the hound he resolved to kill off the remaining baskervilles so that he could come into the inheritance as the last of the line he had no interest in the estate and simply wanted the inheritance money he purchased the hound and hid it in the mire at the site of an abandoned tin mine on the night of his death sir charles had been waiting for laura lyons the cigar ash at the scene the ash had twice dropped from his cigar showed he had waited for some time instead he met the hound that had been trained by stapleton and covered with phosphorus to give it an unearthly appearance sir charles ran for his life but then had the fatal heart attack which killed him since dogs do not eat or bite dead bodies it left him there untouched stapleton followed sir henry in london and also stole his new boot but later returned it since it had not been worn and thus lacked sir henrys scent holmes speculated that the hotel bootblack had been bribed to steal an old boot of henrys instead the hound pursued selden to his death in a fall because he was wearing sir henrys old clothes on the night the hound attacked sir henry stapletons wife had refused to have any further part in stapletons plot but her abusive husband beat and tied her to a pole to prevent her from warning him in holmes words he stapleton has for years been a desperate and dangerous man it was his consuming interest in entomology that allowed holmes to identify him as the same man as vandeleur the former schoolmaster

bloodless meanwhile during a joint military exercise japanese ships accidentally launch torpedoes at the u s pacific fleet destroying two submarines and crippling two aircraft carriers this drastically reduces the u s capability to project power into the western pacific an immediate retaliation is forestalled by the second phase of the japanese offensive an economic attack even as the military offensive begins japan engineers the collapse of the u s stock market by hiring a programmer in an exchange firm to insert a logic bomb into the system which ends up deleting all trade records the japanese also attempt to assassinate the chairman of the federal reserve but their target survives the attempt with a broken back with a massive economic crisis and subsequent mass panic the japanese hope that america will be too distracted to quickly respond to japans military actions japan immediately sues for peace offering international talks and seemingly free elections in the marianas to delay a u s response negotiators secretly reveal to the u s that japan has obtained nuclear ballistic missile capability the japanese oligarchs led by yamata believe that offers of negotiation and the nuclear deterrent defended by a seemingly impregnable awacs system will cause the u s to concede japans advantage with two of americas twelve carriers disabled and the rest pinned down by international crises elsewhere ryan has few resources with which to defend american interests despite his typical focus on military issues ryan advises president durling to deal with the economic crisis first ryan also realizes that japans deletion of trade records could be an advantage in responding to the economic threat he engineers a do over where all of the transactions on the day of the mass deletion are ignored and all assets are restored to their state at the start of business that day accompanied by a presidential address to the nation and behind the scenes bullying of investment banks the plan is a success americas economy is restored with only minor disruption ryan eliminates japans awacs system through a series of accidents using widely dispersed u s assets allowing b bombers to destroy the silos clark and chavez blind incoming japanese pilots with a laser and cause them to crash on landing and rescue japans moderate former prime minister an army special operations team is airdropped into japan to support comanche helicopters in attacking the other awacs planes and kill members of yamatas cabal meanwhile admiral robby jackson liberates the marianas with little bloodshed cornered japans current prime minister resigns ceding power to his predecessor yamata is arrested and the new japanese government accepts americas generous offer of status quo ante throughout the book president durling faces another less important political crisis vice president ed kealty is forced to resign after being accused of drugging and raping a former member of his staff with the crisis over president durling nominates ryan as vice president during a joint session of congress however an embittered japan air lines pilot driven mad by the deaths of his son and brother during the previous conflict flies his boeing directly into the u s capitol nearly the entire presidential line of succession is eliminated ryan who had just been confirmed as vice president moments before narrowly escapes the attack and is immediately sworn in as president
Tunnel in the Sky,Robert A. Heinlein,a malthusian catastrophe on earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation called the ramsbotham jump which is used to send earths excess population to colonize other planets however the costs of operating the device mean that the colonies are isolated from earth until they can justify two way travel because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure more primitive methods are employed for example horses instead of tractors because tractors cannot reproduce themselves rod walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a professional colonist the final test of his advanced survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry but are otherwise completely on their own they are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable on test day each student walks through the ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet though reasonably close to the pickup point rod acting on advice chooses to equip himself with hunting knives and basic survival gear rather than high tech weaponry on the grounds that the latter is dependent on the infrastructure required to maintain it and can easily become a crutch the last advice the students receive is to watch out for stobor on the second day rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief when he wakes up all he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage in his desperate concentration on survival he loses track of time eventually he teams up with jacqueline jack daudet a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male when she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact he realizes that they are stranded they start recruiting others for the long haul and rod becomes the de facto leader of a community that eventually grows to around people rod has no taste for politics or administration and is happy to have grant cowper an older college student and born politician elected mayor grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done despite disagreeing with many of grants policies rod supports him grant ignores rods warning that they are living in a dangerously hard to defend location and that they should move to a cave system he has found when a species previously thought harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through their camp the settlement is devastated and grant is killed rod is subsequently put back in charge heinlein tracks the social development of this community of educated westerners deprived of technology followed by its abrupt dissolution when contact with earth is reestablished after nearly two years of isolation the culture shock experienced by the survivors highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult by reversing the process abruptly each of the students goes from being a personally self responsible member of an autonomous community back to being a youth with little authority or responsibility in the home culture all of the students go back willingly except for rod who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small but sovereign state to a teenager casually brushed aside by the adult rescuers however his teacher and now brother in law and his sister persuade him to change his mind his teacher also informs rod that his warning against stobor robots spelled backwards was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet to instill fear and caution in the students years later rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his hearts desire the novels ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet
The Mismeasure of Man,Stephen Jay Gould,the mismeasure of man is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism about the supposed biologically inherited genetic basis for human intelligence such as craniometry the measurement of skull volume and its relation to intellectual faculties gould proposed that much of the research was based more upon the racial and social prejudices of the researchers than upon their scientific objectivity that on occasion researchers such as samuel george morton louis agassiz and paul broca committed the methodological fallacy of including their personal a priori expectations to the conclusions as part of their analytical reasoning gould describes mortons rather imprecise technique of filling skulls with bird seed to obtain endocranial volume data and how morton had probably pushed down bird seed in the white skulls so that they had more volume gould re worked morton s original endocranial volume data and concluded that the original results were based upon biases selective data use and perhaps outright falsification of the results when said biases are accounted the original hypothesis an ordering in skull volume ranging from blacks to mongols to whites is unsupported by the data the mismeasure of man presents a historical evaluation of the concepts of the intelligence quotient iq and of the general intelligence factor g factor which were and are the measures for intelligence used by psychologists gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased by the belief that the human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity he cites the burt affair about the allegedly fraudulent oft cited twin studies by cyril burt wherein he claimed that human intelligence is highly heritabile as an evolutionary biologist and historian of science gould accepted biological variability the premise of the transmission of intelligence via genetic heredity but opposed biological determinism which posits that genes determine a definitive unalterable social destiny for each man and each woman in life and society the mismeasure of man is an analysis of statistical correlation the mathematics applied by psychologists to establish the validity of iq tests and the heritability of intelligence for example to establish the validity of the proposition that iq is supported by a general intelligence factor g factor the answers to several tests of cognitive ability must positively correlate thus for the g factor to be a heritable trait the iq test scores of close relation respondents must correlate more than the iq test scores of distant relation respondents hence correlation does not imply causation in example gould said that the measures of the changes over time in my age the population of m xico the price of swiss cheese my pet turtle s weight and the average distance between galaxies have a high positive correlation yet that correlation does not indicate that gould s age increased because the mexican population increased more specifically a high positive correlation between the intelligence quotients of a parent and a child can be presumed either as evidence that iq is genetically inherited or that iq is inherited through social and environmental factors moreover because the data from iq tests can be applied to arguing the logical validity of either proposition genetic inheritance and environmental inheritance the psychometric data have no inherent value gould proposed that if the genetic heritability of iq were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group it would not explain the causes of iq differences among the people of a group or if said iq differences can be attributed to the environment for example the height of a person is genetically determined but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors e g the quality of nutrition and to genetic inheritance the evolutionary biologist richard lewontin a colleague of gould s is a proponent of said argument in relation to the cognitive ability tests that determine a person s intelligence quotient an example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not is the statement if all environments were to become equal for everyone heritability would rise to percent because all remaining differences in iq would necessarily be genetic in origin which gould said is misleading at best and false at worst first it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man woman and child grew up in the same environment because their spatial and temporal dispersion upon the planet earth makes it impossible second were people to grew up in the same environment not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development therefore heritability is not a measure of phenotypic physiognomy and physique differences among racial and ethnic groups but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population furthermore he dismissed the proposition that an iq score measures the general intelligence g factor of a person because cognitive ability tests iq tests present different types of questions and the responses tend to form clusters of intellectual acumen that is different questions and the answers to them yield different scores which indicate that an iq test is a combination method of different examinations of different things as such gould proposed that iq test proponents assume the existence of general intelligence as a discrete quality within the human mind and thus they analyze the iq test data to produce an iq number that establishes the definitive general intelligence of each man and of each woman hence dr gould dismissed the iq number as an erroneous artifact of the statistical mathematics applied to the raw iq test data especially because psychometric data can be variously analyzed to produce multiple iq scores
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,the novel begins on a beautiful summer day with lord henry wotton a strongly opinionated man observing the sensitive artist basil hallward painting the portrait of a handsome young man named dorian gray who is basils ultimate muse after hearing lord henrys world view dorian begins to think beauty is the only worthwhile aspect of life he wishes that the portrait basil painted would grow old in his place under the influence of lord henry who relishes the hedonic lifestyle and is a major exponent thereof dorian begins to explore his senses he discovers amazing actress sibyl vane who performs shakespeare plays in a dingy theatre dorian approaches her and soon proposes marriage sibyl who refers to him as prince charming swoons with happiness but her protective brother james tells her that if prince charming harms her he will certainly kill him dorian invites basil and lord henry to see sibyl perform in romeo and juliet sibyl whose only knowledge of love was love of theatre casts aside her acting abilities through the experience of true love with dorian disheartened dorian rejects her saying her beauty was in her acting and he is no longer interested in her when he returns home he notices that his portrait has changed dorian realizes his wish has come true the portrait now bears a subtle sneer and will age with each sin he commits while his own appearance remains unchanged he decides to reconcile with sibyl but lord henry later informs him that she has killed herself by swallowing prussic acid dorian realizes that lust and looks are where his life is headed and he needs nothing else over the next years he experiments with every vice mostly under the influence of a poisonous french decadence novel a present from lord henry the title is never revealed in the novel but at oscar wildes trial he admitted that he had had in mind joris karl huysmanss rebours against nature one night before he leaves for paris basil arrives to question dorian about rumours of his indulgences dorian does not deny his debauchery he takes basil to the portrait which is as hideous as dorians sins in anger dorian blames basil for his fate and stabs basil to death he then blackmails an old friend named alan campbell a chemist into destroying basils body wishing to escape the guilt of his crime dorian travels to an opium den james vane is present there and attempts to shoot dorian after he hears someone refer to dorian as prince charming however he is deceived when dorian fools james into thinking he is too young to have been involved with sibyl years earlier james releases dorian but is approached by a woman from the opium den who chastises him for not killing dorian revealing dorian has not aged for years james attempts to run after him only to find dorian long gone while at dinner dorian sees james stalking the grounds and fears for his life however during a game shooting party a few days later a lurking james is accidentally shot and killed by one of the hunters during this game shooting party dorian develops feelings for lord henry after returning to london dorian tells lord henry that he will be good from now on and has started by not breaking the heart of his latest innocent conquest named hetty merton dorian wonders if the portrait has begun to change back now that he has given up his immoral ways he unveils the portrait to find it has become worse seeing this he realizes that the motives behind his self sacrifice were merely vanity curiosity and the quest for new emotional experiences deciding that only full confession will absolve him he decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience in a rage he picks up the knife that killed basil hallward and plunges it into the painting his servants wake hearing a cry from inside the locked room and passers by on the street fetch the police the servants find dorians body stabbed in the heart and suddenly aged withered and horrible it is only through the rings on his hand that the corpse can be identified beside him however the portrait has reverted to its original form
The Sentinel,Arthur C. Clarke,the story deals with the discovery of an artifact on earths moon left behind eons ago by ancient aliens the object is made of a polished mineral and tetrahedral in shape and is surrounded by a spherical forcefield the narrator speculates at one point that the mysterious aliens who left this structure on the moon may have used mechanisms belonging to a technology that lies beyond our horizons perhaps to the technology of para physical forces the narrator speculates that for millions of years evidenced by dust buildup around its forcefield the artifact has been transmitting signals into deep space but it ceases to transmit when some time later it is destroyed with the savage might of atomic power the narrator hypothesises that this sentinel was left on the moon as a warning beacon for possible intelligent and spacefaring species that might develop on earth in a space odyssey the operation of the sentinel is reversed it is the energy of the sun falling for the first time on the uncovered artifact that triggers the signal that creatures from the earth had taken the first step into space
The Fountains of Paradise,Arthur C. Clarke,in the nd century dr vannevar morgan is a famous structural engineer who hopes to develop the space elevator from a theoretical concept to reality and enlists the resources of his employers to carry out experiments but the only suitable starting point earth station for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in taprobane occupied by an ancient order of buddhist monks who implacably oppose the plan morgan is approached by a mars based consortium to develop the elevator on mars as part of a massive terraforming project to demonstrate the viability of the technology morgan tries to run a thin cable of hyperfilament from an orbital factory down to ground level at taprobane a monk at the monastery a former astrophysicist who is a mathematical genius tries to sabotage the attempt by creating an artificial hurricane using a hijacked weather control satellite his attempt is in fact successful but in an ironic twist the hurricane blows butterflies to the peak of the mountain this fulfills an ancient prophecy that causes the monks to leave the mountain the tower can be built on earth after all forced to resign his position for acting beyond his authority morgan joins the martian consortium named astroengineering and construction of the tower commences several years later the earth based tower is well under construction and travel up and down mdash both for tourists and for transfer to rocket ships mdash is being trialled an astrophysicist and a group of his students and tower staff are stranded in an emergency chamber six hundred kilometres up after an accident with their transport capsule they have limited food and air supplies whilst a laser on a weather control satellite is able to supply heat it is imperative to provide them with filter masks against the increasing carbon dioxide and also with food air and medical supplies a theme earlier explored in clarkes novel the sands of mars despite his rapidly failing health morgan asserts his right to travel up the tower in a one man spider to rescue them he nearly fails with limited battery power but ultimately succeeds in reaching the chamber as morgan surveys the progress of his brainchild his heart disease claims his life a short epilogue envisages earth many centuries later after the sun has cooled and earth has been depopulated with humans now living on the terraformed inner planets several space elevators lead to a giant circumterran space station that encircles earth at geostationary altitude the analogy with a wheel is evident the space station itself is the wheel rim earth is the axle and the six equidistant space elevators the spokes
Lord of the Flies,William Golding,in the midst of a wartime evacuation a british plane crashes onto an isolated island in a remote region of the pacific ocean the only survivors are male children below the age of thirteen two boys the fair haired ralph and an overweight bespectacled boy reluctantly nicknamed piggy find a conch which ralph uses as a horn to bring all the survivors to one area ralph emerges as one of the survivors leaders during the meeting as does jack merridew a member of a boys choir that survived the crash the survivors elect ralph as their chief losing only the votes of jacks fellow choirboys who support their leader ralph asserts two primary goals to have fun and to maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island the boys decide that a conch shell they found embodies the society they shall create on the island and declare that whoever holds the conch shall also receive the respect of the larger group jack organises his choir group into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source ralph jack and a boy named simon soon form a troika of leaders piggy although ralphs only confidante is quickly made an outcast by his fellow biguns older boys and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children simon in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters feels an instinctive need to protect the younger boys the semblance of order imposed by ralph and simon quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle and begin to develop paranoias about the island referring to a supposed monster the beast which dwells nearby jack who has started a power struggle with ralph gains control of the discussion by boldly promising to kill the beast at one point jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire after the fire burns out a ship passes by the island but does not stop as it has seen nothing amiss angered by this ralph considers relinquishing his position but is convinced not to do so by piggy while jack schemes against ralph twins sam and eric now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire see the corpse of a fighter pilot in the dark mistaking the corpse for the beast they run to the cluster of shelters that ralph and simon have erected and warn the others this unexpected meeting sees tensions between jack and ralph flare again shortly thereafter jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island where a heap of stones forms a place where he claims the beast resides only ralph and jacks supporter roger agree to go ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys when they arrive at the shelters jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against ralph asking for them to remove him from his position receiving little support jack roger and another boy leave the shelters to form their own tribe the tribe which receives recruits from the main group of boys grows in strength and begins to adopt customs common to primitive cultures including face paint and bizarre rituals including sacrifices to the beast when the tribe grows to a size that rivals ralphs they begin to harass those who remain at the shelters and make pronouncements encouraging them to abandon ralph and the societal order he has imposed simon unable to bear the stress of his position goes off to think alone he finds a severed pig head left by jack as an offering to the beast simon envisions the pig head now swarming with scavenging flies as the lord of the flies and believes that it is talking to him simon hears the pig identifying itself as the real beast and disclosing the truth about itself nbsp that the boys themselves created the beast and that the real beast was inside them all simon also locates the dead parachutist who had been mistaken for the beast and is the sole member of the group to recognise that the monster is a cadaver simon hoping to tell others of the discovery finds jacks tribe in the islands interior during a ritual dance and mistaken for the beast is killed by the frenzied boys ralph piggy sam and eric feel guilty about what they did not stop jack and his band of savages decide that they should possess piggys glasses the only means of starting a fire on the island raiding ralphs camp the savages confiscate the glasses and return to their abode near the great rock heap called castle rock ralph deserted by most of his supporters journeys to castle rock to confront jack and secure the glasses taking the conch and accompanied only by piggy sam and eric ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object turning against ralph the tribe takes sam and eric captive while roger drops a boulder from his vantage point above killing piggy and shattering the conch ralph manages to escape but sam and eric are tortured until they agree to join jacks tribe the following morning jack orders his tribe to begin a manhunt for ralph fleeing through the forest ralph watches as the savages set fire to the forest drawing the attention of a passing naval vessel a landing party from the vessel encounters ralph as he desperately tries to escape the onrushing savages and the british officer leading the party at first mistaking the violence for a game expected better from british boys
Through the Looking-Glass,Lewis Carroll,alice is playing with a white kitten whom she calls snowdrop and a black kitten whom she calls kitty the offspring of dinah alices cat in alices adventures in wonderland when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirrors reflection climbing up on the fireplace mantel she pokes at the wall hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers to her surprise that she is able to step through it to an alternative world in this reflected version of her own house she finds a book with looking glass poetry jabberwocky whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror she also observes that the chess pieces have come to life though they remain small enough for her to pick up upon leaving the house where it had been a cold snowy night she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers have the power of human speech they perceive alice as being a flower that can move about elsewhere in the garden alice meets the red queen now human sized who impresses alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once in any direction making them the most agile of the pieces the red queen reveals to alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares like a gigantic chessboard and offers to make alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank row in a chess match alice is placed in the second rank as one of the white queens pawns and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move she then meets the fat twin brothers tweedledum and tweedledee whom she knows from the famous nursery rhyme after reciting the long poem the walrus and the carpenter the tweedles draw alices attention to the red king loudly snoring away under a nearby tree and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the red kings dreams thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up finally the brothers begin acting out their nursery rhyme by suiting up for battle only to be frightened away by an enormous crow as the nursery rhyme about them predicts alice next meets the white queen who is very absent minded but boasts of and demonstrates her ability to remember future events before they have happened alice and the white queen advance into the chessboards fifth rank by crossing over a brook together but at the very moment of the crossing the queen transforms into a talking sheep in a small shop alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat where the sheep annoys her with seemingly nonsensical shouting about crabs and feathers unknown to alice these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing and thus the queen sheep for a change is speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way after crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank alice immediately encounters humpty dumpty who besides celebrating his unbirthday provides his own translation of the strange terms in jabberwocky in the process introducing alice and the reader to the concept of portmanteau words before his inevitable fall all the kings horses and all the kings men come to humpty dumptys assistance naturally and are accompanied by the white king along with the lion and the unicorn who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting each other in this chapter the march hare and hatter of the first book make a brief re appearance in the guise of anglo saxon messengers called haigha and hatta i e hare and hatter these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than john tenniels illustrations upon leaving the lion and unicorn to their fight alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the red knight who is intent on capturing the white pawn alice until the white knight comes to her rescue escorting her through the forest towards the final brook crossing the knight recites a long poem of his own composition and repeatedly falls off his horse his clumsiness is a reference to the eccentric l shaped movements of chess knights and may also be interpreted as a self deprecating joke about lewis carrolls own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life bidding farewell to the white knight alice steps across the last brook and is automatically crowned a queen the crown materialising abruptly on her head she soon finds herself in the company of both the white and red queens who relentlessly confound alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion they then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned alice of which alice herself had no prior knowledge alice arrives and seats herself at her own party which quickly turns to a chaotic uproar much like the ending of the first book in which alice finally grabs the red queen believing her to be responsible for all the days nonsense and begins shaking her violently with all her might by thus capturing the red queen alice unknowingly puts the red king who has remained stationary throughout the book into checkmate and is allowed to wake up alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten whom she deduces to have been the red queen all along with the white kitten having been the white queen the story ends with alice recalling the speculation of the tweedle brothers that everything may have in fact been a dream of the red king and that alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination one final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream
Waiting for Godot,Samuel Beckett,waiting for godot follows a pair of men who divert themselves while waiting expectantly vainly for someone named godot to arrive they claim hes an acquaintance but in fact hardly know him admitting that they would not recognize him when they do see him to occupy the time they eat sleep converse argue sing play games exercise swap hats and contemplate suicide anything to hold the terrible silence at bay the play opens with estragon struggling to remove a boot estragon eventually gives up muttering nothing to be done his friend vladimir takes up the thought and muses on it the implication being that nothing is a thing that has to be done and this pair is going to have to spend the rest of the play doing it when estragon finally succeeds in removing his boot he looks and feels inside but finds nothing just prior to this vladimir peers into his hat the motif recurs throughout the play the pair discuss repentance particularly in relation to the two thieves crucified alongside jesus and that only one of the four evangelists mentions that one of them was saved this is the first of numerous biblical references in the play which may be linked to its putative central theme of the search for and reconciliation with god as well as salvation were saved they cry on more than one occasion when they feel that godot may be near presently vladimir expresses his frustration with estragons limited conversational skills come on gogo return the ball cant you once in a while estragon struggles with this throughout the play and vladimir generally takes the lead in dialogue and encounters with others vladimir is at times hostile towards his companion but in general they are close frequently embracing and supporting one another estragon peers out into the audience and comments on the bleakness of his surroundings he wants to depart but is told that they cannot because they must wait for godot the pair cannot agree however on whether or not they are in the right place or that this is the arranged day for their meeting with godot they are not even sure what day it is throughout the play experienced time is attenuated fractured or eerily non existent the only thing that they are fairly sure about is that they are to meet at a tree there is one nearby estragon dozes off but after rousing him vladimir is not interested in hearing about his dream estragon wants to hear an old joke about a brothel which vladimir starts but cannot finish as he is suddenly compelled to rush off and urinate he does not finish the story when he returns asking estragon instead what else they might do to pass the time estragon suggests that they hang themselves but they abandon the idea when it seems that they might not both die leaving one of them alone an intolerable notion they decide to do nothing its safer explains estragon before asking what godot is going to do for them when he arrives for once it is vladimir who struggles to remember oh nothing very definite is the best that he can manage when estragon declares that he is hungry vladimir provides a carrot most of which and without much relish the former eats the diversion ends as estragon announces that they still have nothing to do their waiting is interrupted by the passing through of pozzo and his heavily laden slave lucky a terrible cry from the wings heralds the initial entrance of lucky who has a rope tied around his neck his master appears holding the other end pozzo barks orders at his slave and frequently calls him a pig but is civil towards the other two they mistake him at first for godot and clearly do not recognise him for the self proclaimed personage he is this irks him but while maintaining that the land that they are on is his he acknowledges that the road is free to all deciding to rest for a while pozzo enjoys chicken and wine finished he casts the bones aside and estragon jumps at the chance to ask for them much to vladimirs embarrassment but is told that they belong to the carrier he must first therefore ask lucky if he wants them estragon tries but lucky only hangs his head refusing to answer taking this as a no estragon claims the bones vladimir takes pozzo to task regarding his mistreatment of his slave but his protestations are ignored when the original pairing tries to find out why lucky does not put down his load at least not unless his master is prevailing on him to do something else pozzo explains that lucky is attempting to mollify him to prevent him from selling him at this lucky begins to cry pozzo provides a handkerchief but when estragon tries to wipe his tears away lucky kicks him before he leaves pozzo asks if he can do anything for the pair in exchange for the company they have provided during his rest estragon tries to ask for some money but vladimir cuts him short explaining that they are not beggars they nevertheless accept an offer to have lucky dance and to think the dance is clumsy and shuffling luckys think induced by vladimirs putting his hat on his head is a lengthy and disjointed verbal stream of consciousness the soliloquy begins relatively coherently but quickly dissolves into logorrhoea and only ends when vladimir rips off luckys hat once lucky has been revived pozzo has him pack up his things and they leave at the end of the act and its successor a boy arrives purporting to be a messenger sent from godot to advise the pair that he will not be coming that evening but surely tomorrow during vladimirs interrogation of the boy he asks if he came the day before making it apparent that the two men have been waiting for an indefinite period and will likely continue to wait ad infinitum after the boy departs they decide to leave but make no attempt to do so an action repeated in act ii as the curtain is drawn act ii opens with vladimir singing a recursive round about a dog which could illustrate the cyclical nature of the plays universe and also point toward the plays debt to the carnivalesque music hall traditions and vaudeville comedy this is only one of a number of canine references and allusions in the play there is a bit of realisation by vladimir that the world they are trapped in evinces convoluted progression or lack thereof of time he begins to see that although there is notional evidence of linear progression basically he is living the same day over and over eugene webb has written of vladimirs song that time in the song is not a linear sequence but an endlessly reiterated moment the content of which is only one eternal event death once again estragon maintains he spent the night in a ditch and was beaten by ten of them this time though he shows no sign of injury vladimir tries to talk to him about what appears to be a seasonal change in the tree and the proceedings of the day before but he has only a vague recollection vladimir tries to get estragon to remember pozzo and lucky but all he can call to mind are the bones and getting kicked vladimir realises an opportunity to produce tangible evidence of the previous days events with some difficulty he gets estragon to show him his leg there is a wound which is beginning to fester only then vladimir notices that estragon is not wearing any boots he discovers the pair of boots which estragon insists are not his but nevertheless fit when he tries them on with no carrots left vladimir offers estragon the choice between a turnip and a radish he opts for the radish but it is black and he hands it back he decides to try to sleep again and adopts the same fetal position as the previous day vladimir sings him a lullaby vladimir notices luckys hat and tries it on this leads to a frenetic hat swapping scene they play at imitating pozzo and lucky but estragon can barely remember having met them and simply does what vladimir asks they fire insults at each other and then make up after that they attempt some physical routines which do not work out well and even attempt a single yoga position which fails miserably pozzo and lucky arrive with pozzo now blind and insisting that lucky is dumb the rope is much shorter and lucky who has acquired a new hat leads pozzo rather than being driven by him pozzo has lost all notion of time and assures them he cannot remember meeting them the day before and does not expect to remember the current days events when they are over they fall in a heap estragon sees an opportunity to extort more food or to exact revenge on lucky for kicking him the issue is debated pozzo offers them money but vladimir sees more worth in their entertainment since they are compelled to wait to see if godot arrives eventually though they all find their way onto their feet whereas pozzo in act i is a windbag he now as a blind man appears to have gained some insight his parting words which vladimir expands upon later eloquently encapsulate the brevity of human existence they give birth astride of a grave the light gleams an instant then its night once more lucky and pozzo depart the same boy returns to inform them not to expect godot today but promises he will arrive the next day the two again consider suicide but their rope

2010: Odyssey Two,Arthur C. Clarke,the story is set nine years after the failure of the discovery one mission to jupiter a joint soviet american crew including heywood floyd from on the soviet spaceship alexei leonov named after the famous cosmonaut arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet and to resolve the disappearance of david bowman they hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now abandoned discovery one the soviets have an advanced new sakharov drive which will propel them to jupiter ahead of the american discovery two so floyd is assigned to the leonov crew however a chinese space station rockets out of earth orbit revealing itself to be the interplanetary spacecraft tsien also aimed at jupiter the leonov crewmembers think the chinese are on a one way trip due to its speed but floyd surmises that due to the large water content of europa they intend to land there and use the water content to refuel the tsiens daring mission ends in failure when it is destroyed by an indigenous life form on europa the only survivor radios the story to the leonov it is presumed that he dies when his spacesuit air supply runs out the leonov survives a dangerous aerobraking around jupiter and arrives at discovery mission crewmember and hal s creator dr chandra reactivates the computer to ascertain the cause of his earlier aberrant behavior after some time floyd is speaking to a russian on board who for an instant sees the monolith open again into a stargate as david bowman escapes from the monoliths universe back into ours a sequence of scenes follows the explorations of david bowman who has been transformed into a non corporeal energy based life form much like the aliens controlling the monoliths during his journey the avatar of bowman travels to earth making contact with significant individuals from his human past he visits his mother and brushes her hair shortly before she dies and he appears to his ex girlfriend on her television screen in the novel the aliens are using bowman as a probe to learn about humankind he then returns to the jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of europa where he finds aquatic life forms and under the clouds of jupiter where he discovers gaseous life forms both are primitive but the aliens deem the europan creatures to have evolutionary potential an apparition of bowman appears before floyd warning him that they must leave jupiter within days floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew at first but then the monolith vanishes from orbit and a mysterious dark spot appears on jupiter and begins to grow hals telescope observations reveal that the great black spot is in fact a vast population of monoliths increasing at an exponential rate which appear to be eating the planet the leonov crew devises a plan to use the discovery as a booster rocket enabling them to return to earth ahead of schedule unfortunately hal and the discovery will be trapped in jupiters orbit with insufficient fuel to escape the crew are worried that hal will have the same neuroses on discovering that he will be abandoned yet again so chandra must convince hal that the human crew is in danger the leonov crew flees jupiter as the swarm of monoliths spread to engulf the planet by acting as self replicating von neumann machines these monoliths increase jupiters density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion becoming a small star in the novel this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the jovian atmosphere which the monoliths controllers had deemed less worthy than the aquatic life of europa as jupiter is about to transform bowman returns to discovery to give hal a last order to carry out hal begins repeatedly broadcasting the message the creation of the new star which earth eventually names lucifer destroys discovery however in appreciation for hals help bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove hals artificial intelligence from discoverys computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as david bowman and becomes his companion the book ends with a brief epilogue which takes place in ad by this time the europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilization most likely with assistance from a monolith they are not described in detail though they are said to have tendril like limbs they regard the star lucifer formerly the planet jupiter as their primary sun referring to ours as the cold sun though their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of europa which is constantly bathed in lucifers rays some europans have begun in recent generations to explore the farside the hemisphere facing away from lucifer which is still covered in ice there they may witness the spectacle of night unknown on the other side of europa when the cold sun sets the europans who explore the farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations they correctly believe that lucifer was not always there they believe that the cold sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime the europans also see three other major bodies in the sky one seems to be constantly engulfed in fire and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading these three bodies are the moons io callisto and ganymede the latter two of which are presently being colonized by humans humans have been attempting to explore europa ever since lucifer was created in however none of these attempts has been successful every probe that has attempted to land on europa has been destroyed in the atmosphere as it is later shown in and manned spacecraft that attempt to land have been instead diverted by an external force the debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is venerated by the europans finally there is a monolith on the planet which is worshipped by the europans more than anything else the europans assume correctly that the monolith is what keeps humans at bay dave bowman and hal lie dormant in this monolith the monolith is the guardian of europa and will continue to prevent contact between humans and europans for as long as it sees fit
Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,the novel opens in london in ad in the gregorian calendar the vast majority of the population is unified under the world state an eternally peaceful stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful because the population is permanently limited to no more than two billion people and everyone is happy natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created decanted and raised in hatcheries and conditioning centres where they are divided into five castes which are further split into plus and minus members and designed to fulfill predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the world state fetuses chosen to become members of the highest caste alpha are allowed to develop naturally while maturing to term in decanting bottles while fetuses chosen to become members of the lower castes beta gamma delta epsilon are subjected to in situ chemical interference to cause arrested development in intelligence or physical growth each alpha or beta is the product of one unique fertilized egg developing into one unique fetus members of lower castes are not unique but are instead created using the bokanovsky process which enables a single egg to spawn at the point of the story being told up to children and one ovary to produce thousands of children to further increase the birthrate of gammas deltas and epsilons podsnaps technique causes all the eggs in the ovary to mature simultaneously allowing the hatchery to get full use of the ovary in two years time people of these castes make up the majority of human society and the production of such specialized children bolsters the efficiency and harmony of society since these people are deliberately limited in their cognitive and physical abilities as well as the scope of their ambitions and the complexity of their desires thus rendering them easier to control all children are educated via the hypnopaedic process which provides each child with caste appropriate subconscious messages to mold the childs lifelong self image and social outlook to that chosen by the leaders and their predetermined plans for producing future adult generations to maintain the world states command economy for the indefinite future all citizens are conditioned from birth to value consumption with such platitudes as ending is better than mending more stiches less riches i e buy a new item instead of fixing the old one because constant consumption and near universal employment to meet societys material demands is the bedrock of economic and social stability for the world state beyond providing social engagement and distraction in the material realm of work or play the need for transcendence solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma soma is an allusion to a mythical drink of the same name consumed by ancient indo aryans in the book soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable hangover free holidays it was developed by the world state to provide these inner directed personal experiences within a socially managed context of state run religious organizations social clubs the hypnopaedically inculcated affinity for the state produced drug as a self medicating comfort mechanism in the face of stress or discomfort thereby eliminates the need for religion or other personal allegiances outside or beyond the world state recreational sex is an integral part of society according to the world state sex is a social activity rather than a means of reproduction sex is encouraged from early childhood the few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control even wearing a malthusian belt which resembles a cartridge belt and holds the regulation supply of contraceptives as a popular fashion accessory the maxim everyone belongs to everyone else is repeated often and the idea of a family is considered pornographic sexual competition and emotional romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed marriage natural birth parenthood and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation thus society has developed a new idea of reproductive comprehension spending time alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money and wanting to be an individual is horrifying conditioning trains people to consume and never to enjoy being alone so by spending an afternoon not playing obstacle golf or not in bed with a friend one is forfeiting acceptance in the world state people typically die at age having maintained good health and youthfulness their whole life death isnt feared anyone reflecting upon it is reassured by the knowledge that everyone is happy and that society goes on since no one has family they have no ties to mourn the conditioning system eliminates the need for professional competitiveness people are literally bred to do their jobs and cannot desire another there is no competition within castes each caste member receives the same food housing and soma rationing as every other member of that caste there is no desire to change ones caste largely because a persons sleep conditioning reinforces each individuals place in the caste system to grow closer with members of the same class citizens participate in mock religious services called solidarity services in which twelve people consume large quantities of soma and sing hymns the ritual progresses through group hypnosis and climaxes in an orgy in geographic areas nonconducive to easy living and consumption securely contained groups of savages are left to their own devices these appear to be similar to the reservations of land established for the native american population during the colonisation of north america these savages are beholden of strange customs including self mutilation and religion a mere curio in the outside world in its first chapters the novel describes life in the world state as wonderful and introduces lenina crowne and bernard marx lenina a hatchery worker is socially accepted and comfortable with her place in society while bernard a psychologist is an outcast although an alpha plus bernard is shorter in stature than the average of his caste a quality shared by the lower castes which gives him an inferiority complex his work with sleep teaching has led him to realize that what others believe to be their own deeply held beliefs are merely phrases repeated to children while they are asleep still he recognizes the necessity of such programming as the reason why his society meets the emotional needs of its citizens courting disaster he is vocal about being different once stating he dislikes soma because hed rather be himself bernards differences fuel rumors that he was accidentally administered alcohol while incubated a method used to keep epsilons short bernards only friend is helmholtz watson an alpha plus lecturer at the college of emotional engineering department of writing the friendship is based on their similar experiences as misfits but unlike bernard watsons sense of loneliness stems from being too gifted too intelligent too handsome and too physically strong helmholtz is drawn to bernard as a confidant he can talk to bernard about his desire to write poetry bernard is on holiday at a savage reservation the reservation located in new mexico consists of a community named malpais from afar lenina thinks it will be exciting in person she finds the aged toothless natives who mend their clothes rather than throw them away repugnant and the situation is made worse when she discovers that she has left her soma tablets at the resort hotel in typical tourist fashion bernard and lenina watch what at first appears to be a quaint native ceremony the village folk whose culture resembles the contemporary indian groups of the region descendants of the anasazi including the puebloan peoples of acoma laguna and zuni and the ramah navajo begin by singing but the ritual quickly becomes a passion play where a village boy is whipped to unconsciousness soon after the couple encounters linda a woman who has been living in malpais since she came on a trip and became separated from her group among whom was a man to whom she refers as tomakin but who is revealed to be bernards boss the director of hatcheries and conditioning thomas she became pregnant despite adhering to her malthusian drill and there were no facilities for an abortion her shame at pregnancy was so great that she decided not to return to her old life but to stay with the savages linda gave birth to a son john later referred to as john the savage who is now conversations with linda and john reveal that their life has been hard for years they have been treated as outsiders the native men treated linda like a sex object while the native women regularly beat and ostracized her because of her promiscuity and john was mistreated and excluded for his mothers actions and the color of his skin john was angered by lindas lovers and even attacked one in a jealous rage while a child johns one joy was that his mother had taught him to read although he only had two books a scientific manual from his mothers job which he called a beastly beastly book and a collection of shakespeares works which have been banned in the world state for being subversive shakespeare gives john articulation to his feelings though and he especially is interested in othello romeo and juliet and hamlet at the same time john has been denied the religious rituals of the village although he has watched them and even has had some religious experiences on his own in the desert old weathered and tired linda wants to return to her familiar world in london as she misses living in the city and taking soma john wants to see the brave new world his mother has told him so much about bernard wants to take them back to block thomas from his plan to reassign bernard to iceland as punishment for his asocial beliefs bernard arranges permission for linda and john to leave the reservation john also seems to have an attraction to lenina as while bernard is away getting the permission to move the savages he finds her suitcase and ruffles through all of her clothes taking in the smells he then sees her sleeping and stares at her thinking all he has to do to see her properly is undo one zip he later tells himself off for being like this towards lenina and seems to be extremely shy around her upon his return to london bernard is confronted by thomas the director of the hatchery and conditioning centre who in front of an audience of higher caste centre workers denounces bernard for his asocial behavior bernard thinking that for the first time in his life he has the upper hand defends himself by presenting the director with his long lost lover and unknown son linda and john john falls to his knees and calls thomas his father which causes an uproar of laughter the humiliated director resigns in shame spared from reassignment bernard makes john the toast of london pursued by the highest members of society able to bed any woman he fancies bernard revels in attention he once scorned the victory however is short lived linda decrepit toothless and friendless goes on a permanent soma holiday while john appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society refuses to attend bernards parties society drops bernard as swiftly as it had taken him bernard turns to the person hed believed to be his one true friend only to see helmholtz fall into a quick easy camaraderie with john bernard is left an outcast yet again as he watches the only two men with whom he ever connected find more of interest in each other than they ever did in him john and helmholtzs island of peace is brief lenina tries to seduce john but john pushes her away calling her out on her sexually wanton ways whilst lenina is in the bathroom humiliated and putting her clothes on john receives a telephone call from the hospital telling him that his mother is extremely unwell he rushes over to see her and sits at her bedside trying to get her out of her soma holiday so that he can talk to her he is heartbroken when his mother succumbs to soma and dies he is extremely annoyed by the young boys that enter the ward to be conditioned about death and annoy john to the point where he starts to use violence to send them away johns grief bewilders and revolts the hospital workers and their lack of reaction to lindas death prompts john to try to force humanity from the workers by throwing their soma rations out a window the ensuing riot brings the police who quell the riot by filling the room with soma bernard and helmholtz arrive to help john but only helmholtz helps him while bernard stands to the side torn between risking involvement by helping or escaping the scene following the riot bernard helmholtz and john are brought before mustapha mond the resident world controller for western europe bernard who breaks down during the middle of the conversation and helmholtz are told they will be exiled to islands of their choice mond explains that this exile is not so much a threat to force freethinkers to reform and rejoin society as it is a chance for them to act as they please because they will not be able to influence the population he also divulges that he too once risked banishment to an island because of some scientific experiments that were deemed controversial by the state giving insight into his sympathetic tone helmholtz chooses the falkland islands believing that their terrible weather will inspire his writing but bernard simply does not want to leave london he struggles with mond and is thrown out of the office after bernard and helmholtz have left mustapha and john engage in a philosophical argument on the morals behind the existing society and then john is told the experiment will continue and he will not be sent to an island john meets with bernard and helmholtz once again before their departures from london and bernard apologizes to john for his opportunistic behavior having come to terms with his imminent exile and having restored his friendship with helmholtz in the final chapter john isolates himself from society in a lighthouse outside london where he finds his hermit life interrupted from mourning his mother by the more bitter memories of civilization to atone john brutally whips himself in the open a ritual the indians in his own village had denied him his self flagellation caught on film and shown publicly destroys his hermit life hundreds of gawking sightseers intrigued by johns violent behavior fly out to watch the savage in person even lenina comes to watch crying a tear john does not see the sight of the woman whom he both adores and blames is too much for him john attacks and whips her this sight of genuine unbridled emotion drives the crowd wild with excitement and handling it as they are conditioned to they turn on each other in a frenzy of beating and chanting that devolves into a mass orgy of soma and sex in the morning john hopeless alone horrified by his drug use and the orgy in which he participated that countered his beliefs makes one last attempt to escape civilization and atone when thousands of gawking sightseers arrive that morning frenzied at the prospect of seeing the savage perform again they find john dead from a suicidal hanging
Aeneid,Virgil,the aeneid can be divided into two halves based on the disparate subject matter of books aeneas journey to latium in italy and books the war in latium these two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting virgils ambition to rival homer by treating both the odysseys wandering theme and the iliads warfare themes this is however a rough correspondence the limitations of which should be borne in mind virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme arma virumque cano nbsp i sing of arms and of a man nbsp and an invocation to the muse falling some seven lines after the poems inception musa mihi causas memora nbsp o muse recount to me the causes nbsp he then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story the resentment held by the goddess juno against the trojan people this is consistent with her role throughout the homeric epics also in the manner of homer the story proper begins in medias res with the trojan fleet in the eastern mediterranean heading in the direction of italy the fleet led by aeneas is on a voyage to find a second home it has been foretold that in italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous a race which will become known to all nations juno is wrathful because she had not been chosen in the judgment of paris and because her favorite city carthage will be destroyed by aeneas descendants also ganymede a trojan prince was chosen to be her husband jupiters cup bearer replacing junos daughter hebe juno proceeds to aeolus king of the winds and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe deiopea the loveliest of all her sea nymphs as a wife despite refusing her bribe he agrees and the storm devastates the fleet neptune takes notice although he himself is no friend of the trojans he is infuriated by junos intrusion into his domain and stills the winds and calms the waters after making sure that aeolus would not try again the fleet takes shelter on the coast of africa there aeneass mother venus in the form of a hunting woman very similar to the goddess diana encourages him and tells him the history of the city eventually aeneas ventures in and in the temple of juno seeks and gains the favor of dido queen of carthage the city which has only recently been founded by refugees from tyre and which will later become one of romes greatest imperial rivals and enemies at a banquet given in the honour of the trojans aeneas recounts sadly the events which occasioned the trojans fortuitous arrival he begins the tale shortly after the events described in the iliad crafty ulysses devised a way for greek warriors to gain entry into troy by hiding in a large wooden horse the greeks pretended to sail away leaving a man sinon to tell the trojans that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city the trojans would be able to conquer greece the trojan priest laoco n who had seen through the greek plot and urged the horses destruction hurled his spear at the wooden horse just after in what would be seen by the trojans as punishment from the gods laoco n was suddenly grabbed and eaten along with his two sons by two giant sea snakes so the trojans brought the horse inside the fortified walls and after nightfall the armed greeks emerged and began to slaughter the citys inhabitants aeneas woke up and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city at first he tried to fight against the enemy but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off tens of greeks hector the fallen trojan prince had told him in a dream to flee with his family aeneas tells of his escape with his son ascanius and father anchises after various omens his son ascanius head catches fire without his being harmed and then a shooting star his wife creusa having been separated from the others and subsequently killed in the general catastrophe after getting outside troy he goes back for his wife her ghost appears before him and tells him that his destiny is to found rome he tells of how rallying the other survivors he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the mediterranean thrace where they find the last remains of a fellow trojan polydorus the strophades where they encounter the harpy celaeno crete which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city but they are set straight by apollo and buthrotum this last city had been built in an attempt to replicate troy in buthrotum aeneas met andromache the widow of hector she still laments for the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child there too aeneas saw and met helenus one of priams sons who had the gift of prophecy through him aeneas learned the destiny laid out for him he was divinely advised to seek out the land of italy also known as ausonia or hesperia where his descendants would not only prosper but in time rule the entire known world in addition helenus also bade him go to the sibyl in cumae heading out into the open sea aeneas left buthrotum rounding italys cape and making his way towards sicily trinacria there they are caught in the whirlpool of charybdis and driven out to sea soon they come ashore at the land of the cyclops there they meet a greek achaemenides one of ulysses men who had been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of polyphemus they take achaemenides onboard and narrowly escape polyphemus shortly after these events anchises dies peacefully of old age meanwhile venus has her own plans she goes to her son aeneas half brother cupid and tells him to imitate ascanius disguised as such he goes to dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest with her motherly love revived in the presence of the boy her heart is pierced and she falls in love with the boy and his father during the banquet dido realizes that she has fallen madly in love with aeneas although she had previously sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband sychaeus who had been murdered by her brother pygmalion juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with venus aeneas mother with the intention of distracting him from his destiny of founding a city in italy aeneas is inclined to return didos love and during a hunting expedition a storm drives them into a cave in which aeneas and dido presumably have sex an event that dido takes to indicate a marriage between them but when jupiter sends mercury to remind aeneas of his duty he has no choice but to part her heart broken dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with aeneas sword before dying she predicts eternal strife between aeneass people and hers rise up from my bones avenging spirit trans fitzgerald is an obvious invocation to hannibal looking back from the deck of his ship aeneas sees didos funeral pyres smoke and knows its meaning only too clearly however destiny calls and the trojan fleet sails on to italy book takes place on sicily and centers on the funeral games that aeneas organizes for the anniversary of his fathers death aeneas and his men have left carthage for sicily where one year after the death of his father aeneas organizes a nine day anniversary which includes celebratory games a boat race a foot race a boxing match and a shooting contest in all those contests aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers showing his leadership qualities by not allowing for antagonism even after foul play afterward ascanius leads a military parade and demonstration prefiguring romes future predilection for war during those events in which only men participate juno incites the womenfolk to burn the fleet and prevent them from ever reaching italy but her plan is thwarted when ascanius and then aeneas intervene aeneas prays to jupiter to quench the fires which the god does with a torrential rainstorm an anxious aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father who tells him to go down to the underworld to receive a vision of his and romes future which he will do in book in return for safe passage to italy the gods by order of jupiter will receive one of aeneass men as sacrifice palinurus who steers aeneass ship by night falls overboard and is drowned in book aeneas with the guidance of the cumaean sibyl descends into the underworld through an opening at cumae there he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of rome upon returning to the land of the living aeneas leads the trojans to settle in the land of latium where he courts lavinia the daughter of king latinus although aeneas would have wished to avoid it war eventually breaks out juno is heavily involved in causing this war she convinces the queen of latium to demand that lavinia be married to turnus the king of a local people the rutuli juno continues to stir up trouble even summoning the fury alecto to ensure that a war takes place seeing the masses of italians that turnus has brought against him aeneas seeks help from the tuscans enemies of turnus he meets king evander from arcadia whose son pallas agrees to lead troops against the other italians meanwhile the trojan camp is being attacked and a midnight raid leads to the deaths of nisus and his companion euryalus in one of the most emotional passages in the book the gates however are defended until aeneas returns with his tuscan and arcadian reinforcements in the battling that follows many heroes are killed notably pallas who is killed by turnus and mezentius turnus close associate the latter who has inadvertently allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled reproaches himself and faces aeneas in single combat an honourable but essentially futile pursuit another notable hero camilla a sort of amazon character fights bravely but is eventually killed she has been a virgin devoted to diana and to her nation the man who kills her is struck dead by dianas sentinel opis after doing so even though he tries to escape after this single combat is proposed between aeneas and turnus but aeneas is so obviously superior that the italians urged on by turnuss divine sister juturna break the truce aeneas is injured but returns to the battle shortly afterwards turnus and aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings but when aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of latium causing the queen of latium to hang herself in despair he forces turnus into single combat once more in a dramatic scene turnuss strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock and he is struck by aeneass spear in the leg as turnus is begging on his knees for his life the poem ends with aeneas killing him in rage when he sees that turnus is wearing the belt of his friend pallas as a trophy
Paradise Lost,John Milton,the poem is separated into twelve books or sections and the lengths of each book varies greatly the longest being book ix with lines and the shortest book vii having the arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition originally published in ten books in a fully revised and augmented edition with a new division into twelve books was issued this is the edition that is generally used today the poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res latin for in the midst of things the background story being recounted later miltons story has two narrative arcs one being that of satan lucifer and the other being that of adam and eve it begins after satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to hell or as it is also called in the poem tartarus in pand monium satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers he is aided by mammon and beelzebub belial and moloch are also present at the end of the debate satan volunteers to poison the newly created earth and gods new and most favoured creation mankind he braves the dangers of the abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of odysseus or aeneas after an arduous traverse of the chaos outside hell he enters gods new material world and later the garden of eden at one point in the story the angelic war over heaven is recounted satans rebellion follows the epic convention of large scale warfare the battles between the faithful angels and satans forces take place over three days the final battle involves the son of god single handedly defeating the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishing them from heaven following the purging of heaven god creates the world culminating in his creation of adam and eve while god gave adam and eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation he gave them one explicit command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death the story of adam and eves temptation and fall is a fundamentally different new kind of epic a domestic one adam and eve are presented for the first time in christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without sin they have passions and distinct personalities satan disguised in the form of a serpent successfully tempts eve to eat from the tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric adam learning that eve has sinned knowingly commits the same sin he declares to eve that since she was made from his flesh they are bound to one another so that if she dies he must also die in this manner milton portrays adam as a heroic figure but also as a greater sinner than eve as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong after eating the fruit adam and eve have lustful sex and at first adam is convinced that eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial however they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares and after they awake they experience guilt and shame for the first time realizing that they have committed a terrible act against god they engage in mutual recrimination eves pleas to adam reconcile them somewhat her encouragement enables adam and eve both to approach god to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and to receive grace from god adam is shown a vision by the angel michael in which adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the great flood adam is very upset by this vision of humankinds future and so michael also tells him about humankinds potential redemption from original sin through jesus christ whom michael calls king messiah adam and eve are cast out of eden and michael says that adam may find a paradise within thee happier far adam and eve also now have a more distant relationship with god who is omnipresent but invisible unlike the tangible father in the garden of eden

The Myth of Sisyphus,Albert Camus,the essay is dedicated to pascal pia and is organized in four chapters and one appendix camus undertakes to answer what he considers to be the only question of philosophy that matters does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide he begins by describing the absurd condition much of our life is built on the hope for tomorrow yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy people live as if they didnt know about the certainty of death once stripped of its common romanticisms the world is a foreign strange and inhuman place true knowledge is impossible and rationality and science cannot explain the world their stories ultimately end in meaningless abstractions in metaphors from the moment absurdity is recognized it becomes a passion the most harrowing of all it is not the world that is absurd nor human thought the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world when my appetite for the absolute and for unity meets the inability of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle he then characterizes a number of philosophies that describe and attempt to deal with this feeling of the absurd by heidegger jaspers shestov kierkegaard and husserl all of these he claims commit philosophical suicide by reaching conclusions that contradict the original absurd position either by abandoning reason and turning to god as in the case of kierkegaard and shestov or by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous platonic forms and an abstract god as in the case of husserl for camus who set out to take the absurd seriously and follow it to its final conclusions these leaps cannot convince taking the absurd seriously means acknowledging the contradiction between the desire of human reason and the unreasonable world suicide then also must be rejected without man the absurd cannot exist the contradiction must be lived reason and its limits must be acknowledged without false hope however the absurd can never be accepted it requires constant confrontation constant revolt while the question of human freedom in the metaphysical sense loses interest to the absurd man he gains freedom in a very concrete sense no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity without a need to pursue lifes purpose or to create meaning he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules to embrace the absurd implies embracing all that the unreasonable world has to offer without a meaning in life there is no scale of values what counts is not the best living but the most living thus camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledging of the absurd revolt freedom and passion how should the absurd man live clearly no ethical rules apply as they are all based on higher powers or on justification integrity has no need of rules everything is permitted is not an outburst of relief or of joy but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact camus then goes on to present examples of the absurd life he begins with don juan the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest there is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short lived and exceptional the next example is the actor who depicts ephemeral lives for ephemeral fame he demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being in those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover camus third example of the absurd man is the conqueror the warrior who forgoes all promises of eternity to affect and engage fully in human history he chooses action over contemplation aware of the fact that nothing can last and no victory is final here camus explores the absurd creator or artist since explanation is impossible absurd art is restricted to a description of the myriad experiences in the world if the world were clear art would not exist absurd creation of course also must refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of hope he then analyzes the work of dostoyevsky in this light especially the diary of a writer the possessed and the brothers karamazov all these works start from the absurd position and the first two explore the theme of philosophical suicide but both the diary and his last novel the brothers karamazov ultimately find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as truly absurd creations in the last chapter camus outlines the legend of sisyphus who defied the gods and put death in chains so that no human needed to die when death was eventually liberated and it came time for sisyphus himself to die he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld finally captured the gods decided on his punishment for all eternity he would have to push a rock up a mountain upon reaching the top the rock would roll down again leaving sisyphus to start over camus sees sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest hates death and is condemned to a meaningless task camus presents sisyphuss ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices the workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks and this fate is no less absurd but it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious camus is interested in sisyphus thoughts when marching down the mountain to start anew this is the truly tragic moment when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition he does not have hope but t here is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn acknowledging the truth will conquer it sisyphus just like the absurd man keeps pushing camus claims that when sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance with a nod to the similarly cursed greek hero oedipus camus concludes that all is well indeed that o ne must imagine sisyphus happy the essay contains an appendix titled hope and the absurd in the work of franz kafka while camus acknowledges that kafkas work represents an exquisite description of the absurd condition he maintains that kafka fails as an absurd writer because his work retains a glimmer of hope

The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,the rime of the ancient mariner relates the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage the mariner stops a man who is on the way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story the wedding guests reaction turns from bemusement to impatience and fear to fascination as the mariners story progresses as can be seen in the language style for example coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create either a sense of danger of the supernatural or of serenity depending on the mood of each of the different parts of the poem the mariners tale begins with his ship departing on its journey despite initial good fortune the ship is driven south off course by a storm and eventually reaches antarctica an albatross appears and leads them out of the antarctic but even as the albatross is praised by the ships crew the mariner shoots the bird with my cross bow i shot the albatross the crew is angry with the mariner believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the antarctic however the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist however they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship from the land of mist and snow the south wind that had initially led them from the land of ice now sends the ship into uncharted waters where it is becalmed day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink here however the sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst in anger the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it or perhaps as a sign of regret ah well a day what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung eventually the ship encounters a ghostly vessel on board are death a skeleton and the night mare life in death a deathly pale woman who are playing dice for the souls of the crew with a roll of the dice death wins the lives of the crew members and life in death the life of the mariner a prize she considers more valuable her name is a clue as to the mariners fate he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross one by one all of the crew members die but the mariner lives on seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crews corpses whose last expressions remain upon their faces eventually the mariners curse is temporarily lifted when he sees sea creatures swimming in the water despite his cursing them as slimy things earlier in the poem yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them a spring of love gushd from my heart and i blessd them unaware suddenly as he manages to pray the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated the bodies of the crew possessed by good spirits rise again and steer the ship back home where it sinks in a whirlpool leaving only the mariner behind a hermit on the mainland had seen the approaching ship and had come to meet it with a pilot and the pilots boy in a boat when they pull him from the water they think he is dead but when he opens his mouth the pilot has a fit the hermit prays and the mariner picks up the oars to row the pilots boy goes crazy and laughs thinking the mariner is the devil and says the devil knows how to row as penance for shooting the albatross the mariner driven by guilt is forced to wander the earth tell his story and teach a lesson to those he meets he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all after relating the story the mariner leaves and the wedding guest returns home and wakes the next morning a sadder and a wiser man

indian woman aouda is led to a sanctuary to be sacrificed by the process of suttee the next day by brahmins since the young woman is drugged with the smoke of opium and hemp and is obviously not going voluntarily the travellers decide to rescue her they follow the procession to the site where passepartout secretly takes the place of aoudas deceased husband on the funeral pyre on which she is to be burned the next morning during the ceremony he then rises from the pyre scaring off the priests and carries the young woman away due to this incident the two days gained earlier are lost but fogg shows no sign of regret the travellers then hasten on to catch the train at the next railway station taking aouda with them at calcutta they can finally board a steamer going to hong kong fix who has secretly been following them has fogg and passepartout arrested in calcutta however they jump bail and fix is forced to follow them to hong kong on board he shows himself to passepartout who is delighted to meet again his travelling companion from the earlier voyage in hong kong it turns out that aoudas distant relative in whose care they had been planning to leave her has moved probably to holland so they decide to take her with them to europe meanwhile still without a warrant fix sees hong kong as his last chance to arrest fogg on british soil around this time passepartout becomes convinced that fix is a spy from the reform club trying to see if fogg is really going around the world however fix confides in passepartout who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a bank robber to prevent passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel fix gets passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den in his dizziness passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to yokohama but neglects to inform fogg fogg on the next day discovers that he has missed his connection he goes in search of a vessel that will take him to yokohama he finds a pilot boat that takes him and aouda to shanghai where they catch a steamer to yokohama in yokohama they go on a search for passepartout believing that he may have arrived there on the original boat they find him in a circus trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey reunited the four board a steamer taking them across the pacific to san francisco fix promises passepartout that now having left british soil he will no longer try to delay foggs journey but rather support him in getting back to britain as fast as possible to minimize the amount of his share of the stolen money that fogg can spend in san francisco they get on a trans american train to new york encountering a number of obstacles as well as a mormon missionary along the way a massive herd of bison crossing the tracks a failing suspension bridge and most disastrously the train is attacked and overcome by sioux warriors after heroically uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages

very high price from the captain soothing him thereby and has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam the companions arrive at queenstown cobh ireland in time to reach london via dublin and liverpool before the deadline however once on british soil again fix produces a warrant and arrests fogg a short time later the misunderstanding is cleared up the actual bank robber had been caught three days earlier in edinburgh in response to this fogg in a rare moment of impulse punches fix who immediately falls to the ground however fogg has missed the train and returns to london five minutes late assured that he has lost the wager in his london house the next day he apologises to aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot financially support her aouda suddenly confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her which he gladly accepts he calls for passepartout to notify the reverend at the reverends passepartout learns that he is mistaken in the date which he takes to be sunday but which actually is saturday because the party travelled east thereby gaining a full day on their journey around the globe by crossing the international date line he did not notice this after landing in north america because the only phase of the trip that depended on vehicles departing less often than daily was the atlantic crossing and he had hired his own ship for that passepartout hurries back to fogg who immediately sets off for the reform club where he arrives just in time to win the wager fogg marries aouda and the journey around the world is complete passepartout and fogg carried only a carpet bag with only two shirts and three pairs of stockings each a mackintosh a travelling cloak and a spare pair of shoes the only

sentenced to be blinded with the assistance of a kind friend gulliver escapes to blefuscu where he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship which safely

gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by some sailors who return him to england this book compares the truly moral man to the representative man the latter is clearly shown to be the

yahoos are human beings in their base form gulliver becomes a member of a horses household and comes to both admire and emulate the houyhnhnms and their lifestyle rejecting his fellow humans as merely yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices nature gave them however an assembly of the houyhnhnms rules that gulliver a yahoo with some semblance of reason is a danger to their civilization and expels him he is then rescued against his will by a portuguese ship and is surprised to see that captain pedro de mendez a yahoo is a wise courteous and generous person he returns to his home in england but he is unable to reconcile himself to living among yahoos and becomes a recluse remaining in his house largely avoiding his family

the first living thing seen upon awakening he instructs puck to retrieve the flower so that he can make titania fall in love with the first thing she sees when waking up which he is sure will be an

and the lovers watch the six workmen perform pyramus and thisbe given a lack of preparation the performers are so terrible playing their roles to the point where the guests laugh as if it were meant

equipped with a built in communicator he calls a skull phone as well as a number of ways to commit suicide if the need arises called in by the old man his boss and the head of the organization they go to investigate the report of a flying saucer landing in grinnell iowa after other agents sent earlier fail to report back with them is another agent named mary a stunningly beautiful redhead sam is informed that her life is only slightly less precious than the old mans and that he sam is the most expendable in iowa they discover that the people are being brought under the mental control of repulsive slug like creatures that attach to their backs just below the neck detaching one slug from its host they seal it in a film canister and bring it back to headquarters in washington d c by the time they get there though the remains of the slug are a stinking mess and they are unable to convince the president that there is an invasion sam eventually leads a small team back to iowa they inadvertently succeed in capturing a live slug as one agent becomes hagridden without them realizing it however mary spots it when he does not react to her allure like a normal male the agent is unmasked subdued and confined the slug escapes by transferring to another person and eventually to sam himself he immediately becomes enslaved and escapes the agency meanwhile the invasion continues to expand slugs are shipped through the mail to recruit more humans gradually they infect more and more important people especially the members of exclusive clubs frequented by politicians before the old man tracks sam down and captures him they have infected the assistant secretary of the treasury whose department controls the united states secret service responsible for the presidents personal security the slugs are a step away from infecting the president himself by the time sam recovers in hospital anyone fully dressed is suspect the old man wants someone to wear the slug so it can be interrogated sam cannot bear the idea but when mary volunteers he gives in and does it himself he is completely aware of himself when possessed but totally committed to the slugs cause the slug dies under torture from electric shocks but in the process sam learns that they come from titan the largest moon of saturn thoroughly disgusted by the treatment he has received sam is ready to quit he is at first furious with mary for entrapping him and then with the old man when he learns that his boss tricked mary into it at this point it is revealed that the old man is sams father eventually the politicians realize the danger from minnesota to louisiana the center of the country has been taken over on a solo mission to kansas city sam is shocked to discover that the number of slugs is much greater than thought instead of taking over key people they have absorbed the entire human population of the occupied territory however he and the old man are unable to convince the president to stop a meticulously planned military counter invasion of the heartland the entire force is taken over by the enemy they find that slugs are capable of fissioning in two fairly quickly the number of infected humans must now be so large that any military action would kill tens of millions the problem having reached a scale beyond their ability to influence it sam and mary are given leave by this time they have fallen in love and get married before going to sams bolt hole in the adirondack mountains their idyll is interrupted when a slug takes over first his beloved pet cat then mary sam manages to push mary onto a hot fire to kill the slug leaving them both badly burned but alive and free returning to hq for treatment they find that a new law requires everyone to be functionally naked to show that a slug is not in control the law is rigorously enforced not as much by police as by vigilantes who often shoot first and confirm afterward sam begins to believe that the slugs have him marked for repossession they can communicate by direct conference where their hosts sit back to back and the slugs partially merge a network of such interactions could spread his description rapidly among the invaders who knew how valuable he is some scientists even speculate that the slugs are really just one organism in many bodies for their part the slugs drop all pretenses and openly wage war on the states to their east and west where human hosts cannot go they use animals such as dogs horses and even elephants sam and mary go with the old man to investigate a saucer which crash landed in mississippi inside they encounter the slugs hosts from titan small elf like creatures who died when earths air entered the ship there are also tanks containing humans in suspended animation mary has a mental breakdown when she enters the ship it triggers long suppressed memories from when she was a child in a failed venus colony which was taken over by slugs she herself spent years in one of the tanks mary caught a disease which killed her slug they discover that the disease is nine day fever which is almost fatal if untreated however they find that it kills slugs faster than humans it might just be possible to spread the fever among the slugs using direct conference and then treat as many humans as possible before they die the old man springs a surprise on sam he had expected sam to replace him one day and sam would show when he was ready by opposing the old mans authority from now on sam is in charge official titles notwithstanding time is short diseases erupt in the infected areas as the slugs neglect hygiene and often drive their hosts until they starve outbreaks of plague in the communist countries suggest that they were taken over even before the center of the united states the counter attack begins releasing animals with infected slugs into enemy territory they wait for the epidemic to break out days pass and then calls start coming in from desperate people whose slugs have died hundreds of thousands of agents sam and the old man among them parachute in to treat victims with drug dispensing guns just when the battle seems won the old man is possessed by one of the few healthy slugs and kidnaps sam intending to take them both into hiding to regroup for a new invasion sam watches in horror as the old mans slug begins dividing so he too can be possessed despite being tied up sam is able to crash their flyer into the sea killing the slug in the final section sam writes in a journal before embarking with mary on a spaceship which will take the battle to titan the slugs will remain a problem for years to come having infected too many parts of the earth to root out easily but they will never be able to take over

I Am Legend,Richard Matheson,the main character is robert neville apparently the sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism it is implied that the pandemic was caused by a war and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population the narrative details nevilles daily life in los angeles as he attempts to comprehend research and possibly cure the disease to which he is immune nevilles past is revealed through flashbacks the vampires only come out at night and become comatose by day though they also sometimes come out earlier during cloudy weather neville survives by barricading himself by sunset inside his house further protected by garlic mirrors and crosses swarms of vampires would regularly surround his house trying to find ways to get inside during the day he scavenges for supplies and methodically searches out the inactive vampires driving stakes into their hearts to kill them after bouts of depression and alcoholism neville decides to find out the scientific cause of the pandemic he obtains books and other research materials from a library and through painstaking research discovers the root of the vampiric disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts he also discovers that much of the efficacy of the garlic mirrors and crosses were actually hysterical blindess the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected particularly the religious who believed that they were effective against vampires driven to insanity by the disease the vampires now reacted as they believed they should react when confronted with these items even then it was constrained to the beliefs of the particular person such that a vampire who was christian would fear the cross but a vampire who was jewish would not neville also discovers more efficient means of killing the infected other than just driving a stake into their hearts this included exposing them to direct sunlight which killed the bacteria or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air he is now killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly after three years neville sees an apparently uninfected woman ruth abroad in the daylight and captures her after some convincing ruth tells him her story of how she and her husband survived the pandemic though her husband was killed two weeks earlier neville is puzzled by the fact that she is upset when he speaks of killing vampires on grounds that if her story of survival was true she would have become hardened to the act one night neville is startled awake and finds ruth about to leave suspicious he questions her motives but relates the trauma of his past whereupon they comfort each other ruth reluctantly allows him a blood sample but knocks him senseless when he realizes she is infected when he wakes neville discovers a note from ruth confessing that she is actually infected and that neville was responsible for her husbands death ruth admits that she was sent to spy on him the infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight and are attempting to rebuild society but they fear and hate neville who has destroyed some of their people along with the true vampires dead bodies animated by the germ during his daytime excursions against the latter ruth warns neville that her people will attempt to capture him and that he should leave his house and escape but neville disregards ruths warning and is captured neville wakes in a prison where he is visited by ruth who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but unlike the others does not resent him she acknowledges the need for nevilles execution and gives him pills claiming they will make it easier badly injured neville accepts his fate and asks ruth not to let this society become heartless ruth kisses him and leaves neville goes to his prison window and sees all the infected waiting for his execution judging by their reactions to the sight of him he now recognizes their point of view having hitherto seen the destruction of the infected survivors as a moral imperative to be pursued for his own and mankinds survival he failed to realize that the infected have come to view him in fear and awe to them he was an invisible killer who moved by day killing their loved ones as they hibernated he realizes that even as vampires were legend in pre infection times he a remnant of old humanity is now a legend to the new race born of the infection he therefore remarks to himself as he dies i am a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever i am legend
The Stranger,Albert Camus,part one begins with meursault finding out of his mothers death at her funeral he expresses none of the expected emotions of grief when asked if he wishes to view the body he says no and instead smokes and drinks coffee with milk in front of the coffin rather than expressing his feelings he only comments to the reader about the others at the funeral he later encounters marie a former employee of his firm and the two become re acquainted and begin to have a sexual relationship regardless of the fact that meursaults mother died just a day before in the next few days he helps his friend and neighbour raymond sint s take revenge on a moorish girlfriend suspected of infidelity for raymond meursault agrees to write a letter to his girlfriend with the sole purpose of inviting her over so that raymond can have sex with her but kick her out at the last minute as emotional revenge meursault sees no reason not to help him and it pleases raymond he does not express concern that raymonds girlfriend is going to be emotionally hurt as he believes raymonds story that she has been unfaithful and he himself is both somewhat drunk and characteristically unfazed by any feelings of empathy in general he considers other people either interesting or annoying the letter works the girlfriend returns but the situation escalates when she slaps raymond after he tries to kick her out and raymond beats her raymond is taken to court where meursault testifies that she had been unfaithful and raymond is let off with a warning after this the girlfriends brother and several arab friends begin tailing raymond raymond invites meursault and marie to a friends beach house for the weekend and when there they encounter the spurned girlfriends brother and an arab friend these two confront raymond and wound him with a knife during a fist fight later walking back along the beach alone and now armed with a pistol he took from raymond so that raymond would not do anything rash meursault encounters the arab meursault is now disoriented on the edge of heatstroke and when the arab flashes his knife at him meursault shoots despite killing the arab man with the first gunshot he shoots the corpse four more times after a brief pause he does not divulge to the reader any specific reason for his crime or emotions he experiences at the time if any aside from the fact that he was bothered by the heat and bright sunlight part two begins with meursaults incarceration explaining his arrest time in prison and upcoming trial his general detachment makes living in prison very tolerable especially after he gets used to the idea of not being able to go places whenever he wants to and no longer being able to satisfy his sexual desires with marie he passes the time sleeping or mentally listing the objects he owned back in his apartment building at the trial meursaults quietness and passivity is seen as demonstrative of his seeming lack of remorse or guilt by the prosecuting attorney and so the attorney concentrates more upon meursaults inability or unwillingness to cry at his mothers funeral than on the actual murder the attorney pushes meursault to tell the truth but never comes through and later on his own meursault explains to the reader that he simply was never really able to feel any remorse or personal emotions for any of his actions in life the dramatic prosecutor theatrically denounces meursault to the point that he claims meursault must be a soulless monster incapable of remorse and that he thus deserves to die for his crime although meursaults attorney defends him and later tells meursault that he expects the sentence to be light meursault is alarmed when the judge informs him of the final decision that he will be decapitated publicly in prison while awaiting the execution of his death sentence by the guillotine meursault meets with a chaplain but rejects his proffered opportunity of turning to god explaining that god is a waste of his time although the chaplain persists in attempting to lead meursault from his atheism meursault finally accosts him in a rage with a climactic outburst on his frustrations and the absurdity of the human condition his personal anguish at the meaninglessness of his existence without respite at the beginning of his outrage he mentions other people in anger that they have no right to judge him for his actions or for who he is no one has the right to judge someone else meursault ultimately grasps the universes indifference towards humankind coming to terms with his execution as if that blind rage had washed me clean rid me of hope for the first time in that night alive with signs and stars i opened myself to the benign indifference of the world finding it so much like myself so like a brother really i felt that i had been happy and that i was happy again for everything to be consummated for me to feel less alone i had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with howls of execration

Podkayne of Mars,Robert A. Heinlein,the book is a first person narrative in the form of podkaynes diaries podkayne is in earth years a bit over eight martian years while her genius younger brother clark is earth years martian years due to the unscheduled uncorking birth of their three test tube babies podkaynes parents cancel a much anticipated trip to earth disappointed podkayne confesses her misery to her uncle senator tom fries an elder statesman of the mars government tom arranges for clark and podkayne escorted by himself to get upgraded passage on a luxury liner to earth during boarding clark is asked by a customs official anything to declare and facetiously answers two kilos of happy dust as he anticipated his seemingly flippant remark gets him taken away and searched just in time to divert attention away from podkaynes luggage where he has hidden a package he was paid to smuggle aboard podkayne suspects the reason behind her brothers behavior but cannot prove it clark was told it was a present for the captain but is far too cynical to be taken in he later carefully opens the package and finds a nuclear bomb which he in typical clark fashion disarms and keeps much of the description of the voyage is based on heinleins own experiences as a naval officer and world traveler clarks ploy is taken from a real life incident related in heinleins tramp royale in which his wife answers the same question with heroin substituted for the fictitious but equally illegal happy dust once aboard they are befriended by girdie an attractive capable experienced woman left impoverished by her late husband much to podkaynes surprise the normally very self centered clark contracts a severe case of puppy love the liner makes a stop at venus which is depicted as a latter day las vegas gone ultra capitalistic the planet is controlled by a single corporation the dream of most of the frantically enterprising residents is to earn enough to buy a single share in it which guarantees lifelong financial security just about anything goes as long as one can pay for it the penalty for murder is a fine paid to the corporation for the victims estimated value plus his projected future earnings on a less serious level heinlein anticipated by over forty years television ads in taxicabs in the book holographic which have since been implemented in taxicabs in major cities worldwide the fries are given vip treatment by the venus corporation and podkayne is escorted by dexter cunha the chairmans dashing son she begins to realize that tom is much more than just her pinochle playing uncle when clark vanishes and even the corporation is unable to find him tom reveals that he is on a secret diplomatic mission and the children have been his protective coloration instead of an accredited representative to a vital conference on luna tom appears to be a doddering uncle escorting two young people on a tour of the solar system clark has been kidnapped by functionaries of a political faction opposed to tom podkayne makes an ill judged attempt to rescue clark by herself and falls into the kidnappers clutches as well only to find her uncle caught too the captors scheme is to use the children to blackmail the uncle into doing their bidding at the luna conference clark quickly realizes that once uncle tom is released no matter what happens their kidnappers will have little reason to keep their prisoners alive he is prepared however and engineers an escape leaving a bomb behind to blow up the kidnappers in heinleins original ending podkayne is killed this did not please his publisher who demanded and got a rewrite over the authors bitter objections in a letter to lurton blassingame his literary agent heinlein complained that it would be like revising romeo and juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after he also declared that changing the end isnt real life because in real life not everything ends happily in the original ending after they escape from the kidnappers to a safe distance podkayne remembers that a semi intelligent venerian fairy baby has been left behind and returns to rescue it when the nuclear bomb that clark leaves for the kidnappers blows up podkayne is killed shielding the young fairy with her body clark takes over the narrative for the last chapter the story ends with a hint of hope for him as he admits his responsibility for what happened to podkayne mdash that he fubbed it mighty dry mdash then shows some human feeling by regretting his inability to cry and describes his plan to raise the fairy himself in the revised version podkayne is injured by the bomb but not fatally uncle tom in a phone conversation with podkaynes father blames the parents especially the mother for neglecting the upbringing of the children uncle tom feels that clark is dangerous and maladjusted and attributes this to the mother giving priority to her career clark still takes over as the narrator and again regrets that podkayne was hurt and plans to take care of the fairy this time because podkayne will want to see it when she is better the baen edition includes both endings which differ only on the last page jim baens own edited postlude to the story and a collection of readers essays giving their opinions about which ending is better most of these readers favored the sad ending partly because they felt heinlein should have been free to create his own story and partly because they believed that the changed ending turned a tragedy into a mere adventure and not a very well constructed one at that podkayne appears in heinleins later novel the number of the beast attending the party at the end along with many other heinlein characters from previous books

accompanied by neville and hermione granger into a midnight excursion they accidentally enter a forbidden corridor and find a huge three headed dog the group hastily retreats and hermione notices that

attention from filch for a bite on his leg by the three headed dog during the game harrys broomstick goes out of control endangering his life and hermione notices that snape is staring at harry and muttering she dashes over to the professors stand knocking over professor quirrell in her haste and sets fire to snapes robe harry regains control of his broomstick and catches the golden snitch winning the game for gryffindor hagrid refuses to believe that snape was responsible for harrys danger but lets slip that he bought the three headed dog and that the monster is guarding a secret that belongs to professor dumbledore and someone called nicolas flamel harry and the weasleys stay at hogwarts for christmas and one of harrys presents from an anonymous donor is an invisibility cloak owned by his father harry uses the cloak to search the librarys restricted section for information about the mysterious flamel has to evade snape and filch after an enchanted book shrieks an alarm and slips into a room containing the mirror of erised which shows his parents and several of their ancestors harry becomes addicted to the mirrors visions and is rescued by professor dumbledore who explains that it shows what the viewer most desperately longs for when the rest of the pupils return for the next term draco plays a prank on neville and harry consoles neville with a sweet the collectible card wrapped with the sweet identifies flamel as an alchemist hermione soon finds that he is a year old man who possesses the only known philosophers stone from which can be extracted an elixir of life a few days later harry notices snape sneaking towards the outskirts of the forbidden forest there he half hears a furtive conversation about the philosophers stone in which snape asks professor quirrell if he has found a way past the three headed dog and menacingly tells quirrell to decide whose side he is on harry concludes that snape is trying to steal the stone and quirrell has helped prepare a series of defences for it which was an almost fatal mistake the three friends discover that hagrid is raising a baby dragon which is against wizard law and arrange to smuggle it out of the country around midnight draco arrives hoping to raise the alarm and get them into trouble and goes to tell professor mcgonagall although ron is bitten by the dragon and is sent to the infirmary harry and hermione spirit the dragon safely away however they are caught and harry loses the invisibility cloak as part of their punishment harry hermione draco and neville who trying to stop harry and hermione after hearing what draco had been saying had been caught by mcgonagall as well are compelled to help hagrid to rescue a badly injured unicorn in the forbidden forest they split into two parties and harry and draco find the unicorn dead surrounded by its blood a hooded figure crawls to the corpse and drinks the blood while draco screams and flees the hooded figure moves towards harry who is knocked out by an agonising pain spreading from his scar when harry regains consciousness the hooded figure has gone and a centaur firenze offers to give him a ride back to the school the centaur tells harry that drinking a unicorns blood will save the life of a mortally injured person but at the price of having a cursed life from that moment on firenze suggests voldemort drank the unicorns blood to gain enough strength to make the elixir of life from the philosophers stone and regain full health by drinking that on his return harry finds that someone has slipped the invisibility cloak under his sheets a few weeks later while relaxing after the end of session examinations harry suddenly wonders how something as illegal as a dragons egg came into hagrids possession the gamekeeper says he was given it by a hooded stranger who bought him several drinks and asked him how to get past the three headed dog which hagrid admits is easy music sends it to sleep realising that one of the philosophers stones defences is no longer secure harry goes to inform professor dumbledore only to find that the headmaster has just left for an important meeting harry concludes that snape faked the message that called dumbledore away and will try to steal the stone that night covered by the invisibility cloak harry and his two friends go to the three headed dogs chamber where harry sends the beast to sleep by playing a flute given to him by hagrid for christmas after lifting the trap door they encounter a series of obstacles each of which requires special skills possessed by one of the three and one of which requires ron to sacrifice himself in a game of wizards chess in the final room harry now alone finds quirrell rather than snape quirrell admits that he let in the troll that tried to kill hermione on halloween and that he tried to kill harry during the first quidditch match but was knocked over by hermione snape had been trying to protect harry and suspected quirrell quirrell serves voldemort and after failing to steal the philosophers stone from gringotts allowed his master to possess him in order to improve their chances of success however the only other object in the room is the mirror of erised and quirrell can see no sign of the stone at voldemorts bidding quirrell forces harry to stand in front of the mirror harry feels the stone drop into his pocket and tries to stall quirrell removes his turban revealing the face of voldemort on the back of his head voldemort quirrell tries to grab the stone from harry but simply touching harry causes quirrells flesh to burn after further struggles harry passes out he awakes in the school hospital where professor dumbledore tells him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her life to protect him and voldemort could not understand the power of such love voldemort left quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means dumbledore had foreseen that the mirror would show voldemort quirrell only themselves making the elixir of life as they wanted to use the philosophers stone harry was able to see the stone in the mirror because he wanted to find it but not to use it the stone has now been destroyed harry returns to the dursleys for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside hogwarts after ten years harry became an eleven year old boy the dursleys have kept the truth about harrys parents from him but it is revealed in the form of rubeus hagrid who tells harry that he is a wizard and has been accepted at hogwarts for the autumn term harry takes the train to hogwarts from kings cross station on the train harry sits with and quickly befriends ron weasley the two are also briefly visited by neville longbottom and hermione granger later on in the journey malfoy comes into harry and rons compartment with his friends crabbe and goyle and introduces himself after ron laughs at dracos name draco

fluffy who guards a trapdoor in the forbidden third floor passageway on halloween a troll enters the castle and traps hermione in one of the girls lavatories harry and ron rescue her but are caught by professor mcgonagall hermione defends the boys and takes the blame which results in the three becoming close friends harrys broom becomes jinxed during his first quidditch match nearly resulting in harry falling from a great height hermione believes that professor snape has cursed the broom and distracts him by setting his robes on fire allowing harry to catch the golden snitch and win the game for gryffindor at christmas harry receives his fathers invisibility cloak from an unknown source later he discovers the mirror of erised a strange mirror that shows harry surrounded by his parents and the extended family he never knew later harry learns that nicolas flamel is the maker of the sorcerers stone a stone that gives the owner eternal life harry sees professor snape interrogating professor quirrell about getting past fluffy seemingly confirming the suspicion that snape is trying to steal the philosophers stone in order to restore lord voldemort to power the trio discover that hagrid is hiding a dragon egg which hatches since dragon breeding is illegal they convince hagrid to send the dragon to live with others of its kind harry and hermione are caught returning to their dormitories after sending norbert off and are forced to serve detention with hagrid in the forbidden forest in the forest harry sees a hooded figure drink the blood of an injured unicorn firenze a centaur tells harry that the hooded figure is voldemort hagrid accidentally tells harry ron and hermione how to get past fluffy and they rush to tell the headmaster albus dumbledore what they know only to find that he has been called away from the school convinced that dumbledores summons was a red herring to take him away while the philosophers stone is stolen the trio set out to reach the stone first they navigate a series of complex magical challenges set up by the schools faculty and at the end of these challenges harry enters the inner chamber alone only to find that it is the timid professor quirrell not snape who is after the stone the final challenge protecting the stone is the mirror of erised quirrell forces harry to look into the mirror to discover where the stone is hidden and harry successfully resists and the stone drops into his own pocket lord voldemort reveals himself he has possessed quirrell and appears as a ghastly face on the back of quirrells head quirrell tries to attack harry but merely touching harry proves to be agony for him voldemort flees and quirrell dies as dumbledore arrives back in time to save harry as harry recovers dumbledore confirms that lily had died while trying to protect harry as an infant her pure loving sacrifice provides her son with an ancient magical protection against voldemorts lethal spells dumbledore also explains that the philosophers stone has been destroyed to prevent voldemort from ever using it he then tells harry that only those who wanted to find the stone but not use it would be able to retrieve it from the mirror which is why harry could acquire it when harry asks dumbledore why voldemort attempted to kill him when he was an infant dumbledore promises to tell harry when he is older at the end of year feast where harry is welcomed as a hero dumbledore gives a few last minute additions granting enough points to harry ron hermione and neville longbottom for gryffindor to win the house cup ending slytherins six year reign as house champions
Down and Out in Paris and London,George Orwell,two verbless sentences introduce the scene setting opening chapters which describe the atmosphere in the paris quarter and introduce various characters who appear later in the book from chapter iii to chapter x where the narrator obtains a job at hotel x he describes his descent into poverty often in tragi comic terms an italian compositor forges room keys and steals his savings and his scant income vanishes when the english lessons he is giving stop he begins at first to sell some of his clothes and then to pawn his remaining clothes and then searches for work with a russian waiter named boris work as a porter at les halles work as an english teacher and restaurant work he recounts his two day experience without any food and tells of meeting russian communists who he later concludes on their disappearance must be mere swindlers after the various ordeals of unemployment and hunger the narrator obtains a job as a plongeur dishwasher in the h tel x near the place de la concorde and begins to work long hours there in chapter xiii he describes the caste system of the hotel manager cooks waiters plongeurs and in chapter xiv its frantic and seemingly chaotic workings he notes also the dirt in the h tel x which became apparent as soon as one penetrated into the service quarters he talks of his routine life among the working poor of paris slaving and sleeping and then drinking on saturday night through the early hours of sunday morning in chapter xvi he refers briefly to a murder committed just beneath my window while he was sleeping the thing that strikes me in looking back he says is that i was in bed and asleep within three minutes of the murder we were working people and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder misled by boriss optimism the narrator is briefly penniless again after he and boris quit their hotel jobs in the expectation of work at a new restaurant the auberge de jehan cottard where boris feels sure he will become a waiter again at the hotel x he had been doing lower grade work the patron of the auberge an ex colonel of the russian army seems to have financial difficulties the narrator is not paid for ten days and is compelled to spend a night on a bench it was very uncomfortable the arm of the seat cuts into your back and much colder than i had expected rather than face his landlady over the outstanding rent at the restaurant the narrator finds himself working seventeen and a half hours a day almost without a break and looking back wistfully at his relatively leisured and orderly life at the hotel x boris works even longer eighteen hours a day seven days a week the narrator claims that such hours though not usual are nothing extraordinary in paris he adds by the way that the auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating house frequented by students and workmen we did not provide an adequate meal at less than twenty five francs and we were picturesque and artistic which sent up our social standing there were the indecent pictures in the bar and the norman decorations sham beams on the walls electric lights done up as candlesticks peasant pottery even a mounting block at the door and the patron and the head waiter were russian officers and many of the customers titled russian refugees in short we were decidedly chic he falls into a routine again and speaks of quite literally fighting for a place on the paris m tro in order to reach the cold filthy kitchen by seven despite the filth and incompetence the restaurant turns out to be a success the narrative is interspersed with anecdotes recounted by some of the minor characters such as valenti an italian waiter at hotel x and charlie one of the local curiosities who is a youth of family and education who had run away from home in chapter xxii the narrator considers the life of a plongeur a plongeur is one of the slaves of the modern world not that there is any need to whine over him for he is better off than many manual workers but still he is no freer than if he were bought and sold his work is servile and without art he is paid just enough to keep him alive his only holiday is the sack he has been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible if plongeurs thought at all they would long ago have formed a labour union and gone on strike for better treatment but they do not think because they have no leisure for it their life has made slaves of them because of the stress of the long hours he mails to a friend b back in london asking if he could get him a job that allows more than five hours sleep a night his friend duly replies offering a job taking care of a congenital imbecile and sends him some money to get his possessions from the pawn the narrator then quits his job as a plongeur and leaves for london the narrator arrives in london expecting to have the job waiting for him unfortunately the would be employers have gone abroad patient and all until his employers return the narrator lives as a tramp sleeping in an assortment of venues lodging houses tramps hostels or spikes and salvation army shelters because vagrants can not enter any one spike or any two london spikes more than once in a month on pain of being confined for a week he is required to keep on the move with the result that long hours are spent tramping or waiting for hostels to open chapters xxv to xxxv describe his various journeys the different forms of accommodation a selection of the people he meets and the tramps reaction to christian charity evidently the tramps were not grateful for their free tea and yet it was excellent i am sure too that it was given in a good spirit without any intention of humiliating us so in fairness we ought to have been grateful still we were not characters in this section of the book include the irish tramp called paddy a good fellow whose ignorance was limitless and appalling and the pavement artist bozo who has a good literary background and was formerly an amateur astronomer but who has suffered a succession of misfortunes the final chapters provide a catalogue of various types of accommodation open to tramps the narrator offers some general remarks concluding at present i do not feel that i have seen more than the fringe of poverty still i can point to one or two things i have definitely learned by being hard up i shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels nor expect a beggar to be grateful when i give him a penny nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy nor subscribe to the salvation army nor pawn my clothes nor refuse a handbill nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant that is a beginning

Dick,set in the late s and s the story describes the efforts of episcopal bishop timothy archer who must cope with the theological and philosophical implications of the newly discovered gnostic zadokite scroll fragments the character of bishop archer is loosely based on the controversial iconoclastic episcopal bishop james pike who in died of exposure while exploring the judean desert near the dead sea in the west bank as the novel opens it is on the day that john lennon is shot and killed angel archer visits the houseboat of edgar barefoot a guru and reflects on the lives of her deceased relatives during the sixties she was married to jeff archer son of the episcopal bishop of california timothy archer she introduced kirsten lundborg a friend to her father in law and the two began an affair kirsten has a son bill from a previous relationship who has schizophrenia although he is knowledgeable as an automobile mechanic tim is already being investigated for his gnostic allegedly heretical views about the zadokite scrolls which reproduce some of jesus christs statements about the world but have been dated to the second century before the birth of christ jeff commits suicide due to his romantic obsession with kirsten however after poltergeist activity he manifests to tim and kirsten at a seance also attended by angel angel is sceptical about the efficacy of astrology and believes that the unfolding existential situation of tim and kirsten is akin to friedrich schillers german romanticism era masterpiece the wallenstein trilogy insofar as their credulity reflects the loss of rational belief in contemporary consensual reality the three are told that kirsten and tim will die as predicted kirsten loses her remission from cancer and also commits suicide after a barbiturate overdose tim travels to israel to investigate whether or not a psychotropic mushroom was associated with the resurrection but his car stalls he becomes disoriented falls from a cliff and dies in the desert on the houseboat angel is reunited with bill kirstens son who has schizophrenia he claims to have tims reincarnated spirit within him but is soon reinsitutionalised angel agrees to care for bill in return for a rare record that edgar offers her transmigration is one of dicks most overtly philosophical and intellectual works while dicks novels usually employ multiple narrators or an omniscient perspective this story is told in the first person by a single narrator angel archer bishop archers daughter in law dicks work was often criticized for its flat stereotypical female characters so angel may represent his effort to prove he could create a rich and believable feminine voice

Dick,set during a war between the starmen inhabitants of the planet lilistar and the reegs now wait for last year is the story of eric sweetscent an organ transplant doctor who gets wrapped up in earth lilistar politics at the onset of the story sweetscent is the personal org trans surgeon for virgil ackerman the president of tijuana fur dye using an extraterrestrial amoeba which can imitate the cell structure of anything it touches tf d had been the largest manufacturer of synthetic furs on the planet but like all major corporations on earth tf d has been requisitioned to produce for the war effort ackerman invites sweetscent to wash a recreation of his boyhood native washington dc in a simulated and his vacation getaway on mars where he announces an ulterior motive in the retreat waiting for them when they arrive is a guest gino molinari the elected leader of earth known as the mole he is rumored to have the enigmatic ability to come back from the dead and he has requested the services of sweetscent ackerman gladly passes sweetscent on to molinari meanwhile sweetscents wife kathy tries jj a new hallucinogenic drug which proves to be highly toxic and addictive the effects of jj are not clear at first however only hours off of it kathy finds herself unable to function and violently craving jj again she is visited by starmen who claim the reegs invented jj as a chemical weapon against the starmen and terrans also stating that there is no known cure for the drugs addiction and thats why we put you on it kathy is now a slave to jj the starmen inform kathy of her husbands new position with molinari and suspect the latters possible defection to the reegs kathy is promised more jj if she agrees to spy on her husband for lilistar threatened with deportation kathy capitulates and agrees to their terms eventually she takes a second dose of the drug as her ability to function becomes nearly impossible due the effects of the withdrawal jumping into a taxi cab both she and the cab are plunged back in time to the mid th century as the effects of the drug wear off they slowly make their way back to the present time uncertain as to whether the past they visited was their own or an alternate one an increasingly paranoid kathy sets off to visit her husband under his new employer eric sweetscent is let in on certain state secrets molinari seems to have a psychosomatic condition that mirrors any illness or disease of anyone in his vicinity the effects of this condition appear to be real yet the mole pulls through every time always returning from the brink of death molinari like everyone else has realized that in siding with the starmen earth has doomed itself to the wrong side of a losing war however there does not seem to be any safe way of defecting to the reegs and molinari fears that his deteriorating health will not instill confidence in the terrans should the starmen retaliate as they are certain to do sweetscent is shown footage of a healthier younger molinari in uniform and is led to believe that an android look alike of the president has been created for public appearances a notion that does not account for the fact that there is at least one other molinari on the premises a bullet ridden corpse that is being preserved for use in the event of certain possible future developments kathy arrives to inform her husband of her addiction and in an effort to motivate him to find a cure she slips a pill of jj into his drink without enough time to be furious eric slips a year into the future of an alternate world where his colleagues inform him that he disappeared the day kathy came to visit sweetscent also witnesses that in the new timeline earth has sided with the reegs and lilistar has lost the war upon returning to the present of his own timeline sweetscent is eager to present this information to molinari who reveals that he too has been taking jj and that the effect is different for each user certain users are sent to the past while others are sent to the future each trip is in an alternate universe and therefore no one can effectively change their own past or future however aside from minor details events in all observed universes seem to be moving in the same direction and therefore information obtained from one alternate worlds future will most likely be applicable to another in molinaris case he slips sideways in time under the drugs influence and is able to pull alternate versions of his present self into his own timeline and then keep them there having learned the secret to molinaris alter aliases as well as confirming the feasibility of an alliance with the reegs eric takes a larger dose of jj which propels him further into the future while there he obtains a cure for jj s addiction an item of wide accessibility in the future as well as obtaining more information about the possible future of the war in his own timeline he also gathers information as to the effects of jj on the brain as he is increasingly worried about kathys mental condition taking a fraction of a pill so as to not immediately return to his own time eric again ends up one year in his own future where the starmen have occupied earth after learning of the terrans defection to the reegs he is arrested by a star patrol but saved by his future self who informs him that ackerman and the rest of the crew at tf d have taken a stand against lilistar using ackermans getaway on mars as their hideout now knowing the general future history of the next few years eric returns to his own time where his wifes mental condition is deteriorating every day he resolves to check her into a clinic and is sent into deep reflection about the nature of their relationship feeling that he would be justified he attempts to arrange an affair with a younger girl at molinaris recommendation however he backs out of it and begins to slip into a deep depression while reflecting on his life he goes to mexico to purchase poison with which to commit suicide deciding against it at the last second eric watches as the starmen begin their invasion of earth deciding that he is destined to join ackermans resistance against the starmen eric enters an automated cab bound for tf d asking it what it would do if its wife suffered from brain damage without possibility of recovery which eric had confirmed by contacting his future self after pointing out that robots do not marry the cab hypothetically concludes that it would stay with her life argues the cab is made up of a series of circumstances different for each person to leave ones wife would be to say that he requires a uniquely easier set of circumstances than what has been provided that reasoning to the cab was an irrational way of thinking eric agrees and decides to stay with his wife despite the challenges presented by her condition and in the closing paragraph he is thereby commended by the cab for being a good man fr en attendant lann e derni re it

Stranger in a Strange Land,Robert A. Heinlein,the story focuses on a human raised on mars and his adaptation to and understanding of humans and their culture which is portrayed as an amplified version of the consumerist and media driven th century united states protagonist valentine michael smith is the son of astronauts of the first expedition to the planet mars orphaned after the crew died smith was raised in the culture of the martian natives who possess full control over their minds and bodies learned skills which smith acquires a second expedition some twenty years later brings smith to earth because he is heir to the fortunes of the entire exploration party which includes several valuable inventions most particularly his mothers lyle drive which makes interplanetary travel economical smith becomes a political pawn in government struggles moreover despite the existence of the martians under terrestrial law mars was terra nullius wherefore according to some interpretations of law smith could be considered to own the planet mars itself because smith is unaccustomed to the atmosphere and gravity of earth he is confined at bethesda hospital where having never seen a human female he is attended by male staff only seeing this restriction as a challenge nurse gillian boardman eludes guards to see smith and in doing so inadvertently becomes his first female water brother by sharing a glass of water with him considered a holy relationship by the standards of arid mars when gillian tells reporter ben caxton about her experience with smith they attempt to counteract the governments lies about smith after ben disappears at the behest of the world government gillian persuades smith to leave the hospital with her but they are attacked by government agents smith discards the agents irretrievably into a fourth dimension then is so shocked by gillians terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia gillian remembering bens reference to jubal harshaw a famous author who is also a physician and a lawyer conveys smith to the latter smith continues to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence coupled with a childlike na vet when jubal tries to explain religion to him smith understands the concept of god only as one who groks which includes every extant organism this leads him to express the martian concept of life as the phrase thou art god although he knows this is a bad translation many other human concepts such as war clothing and jealousy are strange to him while the idea of an afterlife is a fact he takes for granted because the government on mars is composed of old ones the spirits of martians who have died it is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead in a spirit of holy communion eventually harshaw arranges freedom for smith and recognition that human law which would have granted ownership of mars to smith has no applicability to a planet already inhabited by intelligent life now free to travel smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the elite of earth he investigates many religions including the fosterite church of the new revelation a populist megachurch wherein sexuality gambling alcoholism and similar are not considered sinful but encouraged even within the church building the church is organized in a complexity of initiatory levels an outer circle open to the public a middle circle of ordinary members who support the church financially and an inner circle of the eternally saved attractive highly sexed men and women who serve as clergy and recruit new members the church owns many politicians and takes violent action against those who oppose it smith also has a brief career as a magician in a carnival where he and gillian befriend the shows tattooed lady an eternally saved fosterite woman named patricia paiwonski eventually smith begets a martian influenced church of all worlds combining elements of the fosterite cult especially the sexual aspects with western esotericism whose members learn the martian language and acquire psychokinetic abilities the church is eventually besieged by fosterites for practicing blasphemy and the church building destroyed but smith and his followers teleport to safety smith is arrested by the police but escapes and returns to his followers later explaining to jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the church with it and their new abilities church members will be able to re organize human societies and cultures eventually those who cannot or will not learn smiths methods will die out leaving homo superior incidentally this may save earth from eventual destruction by the martians who we are told were responsible for the destruction of planet v smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the fosterites but speaks briefly to jubal from the afterlife saving him from an attempted suicide after the horror of smiths own death having consumed smiths remains in keeping with his own wishes jubal and some of the church members return to jubals home to re create their former conditions meanwhile smith re appears in the afterlife to replace the fosterites eponymous founder amid hints that smith was an incarnation of the archangel michael

given his blessing the engagement becomes public the secrets behind jane and franks behavior are revealed and emma is chagrined to discover that once again she has been so wrong about so much emma is

believes he returns her feelings emma is dumbstruck over what she at first thinks is the impropriety of the match but as she faces her feelings of dismay and jealousy she realizes in a flash that she has long been in love with mr knightley herself she is shattered to think that it may be too late and resolves to support her dear friends in whatever they do even at the cost of her own broken heart

Consider Phlebas,Iain Banks,the culture and the idiran empire are at war in a galaxy spanning conflict horza a mercenary capable of altering his appearance at will a changer is assigned the task of retrieving a dispossessed culture mind by his idiran handlers the mind while fleeing attacking idirans who consider its existence an abomination has taken refuge on schars world a planet of the dead planets of the dead are nominally forbidden to both the culture and the idirans being under the control of god like incorporeal beings called draazon horza however was one of a group of changers allowed to be on the planet as stewards and witnesses to its devastation he may be the only person in the galaxy and certainly the only one known to the idirans who would be allowed to return on the way to schars world he encounters and joins a band of mercenaries and pirates led by kraiklyn on their ship the clear air turbulence all the while he is doggedly pursued by a culture special circumstances agent perosteck balveda the culture also realizes that horza is the key to getting to schars world and retrieving the mind their plan is to place an agent with him and hope that the agent can get to the mind first and somehow leave with it the plot takes many digressions on the way to the denouement as the book opens horza is about to die an extremely unpleasant death after killing and impersonating a member of the gerontocracy on a world not yet part of the culture here he meets balveda for the first time he is rescued by the idirans and given his mission to find the culture mind but the idiran ship on which he is travelling is soon captured by a culture ship drifting in an escape suit he is picked up by an independent ship the clear air turbulence crewed by a free company of mercenaries and he has to fight and kill one of them while still in the form of a very old man in order to prevent them dumping him back into space horza soon resolves to take over the ship by replacing the captain kraiklyn who leads them on some disastrous pirate raids which kill several of the crew the first raid backfires because the team is unaware that the temple they plan to rob has been built of laser reflecting crystal which turns their beams back on themselves the next raid takes place on the orbital vavatch a massive artificial ringworld million kilometres in diameter which the culture is about to destroy to prevent the idirans taking it over the crew lands on an abandoned megaliner cruising the vavatch ocean hoping to salvage its powerful laser weapons before the orbital is destroyed but one of the crew is killed soon after landing because he missed the briefing warning them that their antigravity devices would not work there and more die when the ship crashes into a massive ice wall which kraiklyn had mistaken for a cloud bank although horza later discovers that kraiklyn and several others managed to escape horza flees the disaster in the damaged cat shuttle but it crashes into the sea near an isolated island killing the pilot there he is taken prisoner by a bizarre cult led by a monstrously obese homicidal cannibal whose followers subsist on food that has been cooked to remove almost all nutritive value and mixed with effluent horza escapes his impending sacrifice by killing the cult leader and his henchman with his poisoned fingernails and teeth and eventually makes his way to the main city on vavatch to find kraiklyn having now changed his appearance to mimic that of the cat captain horza witnesses a game of damage which kraiklyn has joined in the hopes of winning enough to make up the losses from his foolhardy expeditions with the crew damage is a card game enhanced with psychological and emotional pressure by direct mind to mind contact where the tokens of play are actual living beings who are killed when a player loses a round the game is illegal and only played in places where the normal order is breaking down as in the case of vavatch which is being evacuated kraiklyn is wiped out of the game and horza then follows him on his way back to his ship kills him and returns to the cat there to his dismay he is introduced to the newest crew member although disguised he immediately recognises her as perosteck balveda just as horza immobilises her with a stun gun culture agents outside try to capture the ship horza manages to lift off and takes the clear air turbulence on a wild ride through the massive spaces of the ex culture gsv which is carrying out the evacuation and they escape into space after shaking off their culture pursuers although a culture drone unaha closp is also trapped on the escaping ship and becomes a reluctant member of the team as the fugitives warp away from vavatch they see the orbital destroyed by the culture warships balveda now exposed as a culture agent in turn exposes horza seeing no reason to continue his deception he instead recruits the remnants of the crew to carry out his mission the final chapters are action packed horza and his crew land on schars world and go in search for the mind in the labyrinthine command system a vast subterranean complex built as a nuclear warfare command centre ultimately though it was germ warfare which wiped out all life on the planet of the dead they soon discover that the mind is also being hunted by a pair of idiran soldiers survivors of a larger commando group who have killed all the changers stationed on the planet and who regard horza and his crew as enemies having no knowledge of the changers alliance with the idirans horza has kept balveda alive possibly as a hostage and she goes along with the mission awaiting her chance to swing the outcome in the cultures favour horzas situation is further complicated when his crewmate yalson reveals that she is pregnant to him the free company encounter the idirans in one of the command system stations but after an intense firefight they apparently kill one and manage to capture the other after tracking the mind to another station the drone unaha closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a command system train but while the team are distracted the captured idiran xoxarle frees itself kills the guard and sets an ambush for the others meanwhile the second idiran who was mortally wounded but not killed has managed to set one of the trains for a collision course and as it smashes into the station xoxarle springs his ambush and yalson is killed the enraged horza pursues xoxarle who catches balveda and leaves her for dead although she is saved by horza in the climactic fight horza is overwhelmed but thanks to the combined action of the drone and balveda xoxarle is finally killed although the mind has been rescued the cost has been terrible all the crew of the clear air turbulence have been killed the drone is severely damaged and the fatally wounded horza dies just as balveda gets him back to the surface
Inversions,Iain Banks,the book takes place on a fictional planet based on late middle ages europe it alternates chapter by chapter between two concurrent storylines the first storyline is presented as a written account from oelph publicly a doctors assistant but privately a spy for an individual identified only as master to whom much of the account is addressed oelph is the assistant to vosill the personal doctor to king quience of haspidus and a woman the latter is unheard of in the patriarchal kingdom and is tolerated only because vosill claims citizenship in the far off country of drezen the king himself is appreciative of her and her talents but nonetheless her elevated position in defiance of the kingdoms social mores inspires hostility among others of the court oelphs account follows vosill as she attends to the king regularly as well as more charitable ministrations to the impoverished and those in need her methods are unconventional by kingdom standards for example forgoing the use of leeches and instead using alcohol to kill the ill humours which can infect a wound but are more often than not successful this only serves to inspire more distrust amongst her detractors notably including a number of dukes as well as the kings guard commander adlain on this topic oelph includes a transcript he claims to have found in vosills journal purported to be an exchange between duke walen and adlain in which they make an agreement should it become necessary to covertly kidnap the lady doctor and have nolieti the kings chief torturer put her to the question oelph notes that while the transcript appears to have been obtained under impossible circumstances he somehow does not doubt its veracity while vosill attends to the king nolietis is murdered nearly decapitated presumably by his assistant unoure vosill examines the body and determines that unoure could not have killed his master but her explanation is disregarded unoure is captured but before he can be questioned he is found in his cell dead from a cut throat apparently self inflicted following this account oelph includes another found transcript this time between walen and duke quettil though walen is unable to obtain quettils agreement for the use of ralinge his own chief torturer in walens kidnapping plan some days later at a masked ball walen is found murdered this time by a stab to the heart the dukes murder disquiets much of the royal house as it occurred in a room no one entered or left resentment towards vosill continues to build particularly after king quience begins implementing somewhat radical reforms such as permitting commoners to own farmland without the oversight of a noble reforms which vosill has discussed with the king publicly and at length following these reforms vosill confesses to the king that she loves him a sentiment he rebuffs and further hurts her when he states that he prefers pretty dainty delicate women who have no brains oelph finds her after this drunk and hints at his own feelings of love towards her she rebuffs him as well albeit gently some days later vosill receives a note from adlain asking her to meet him and two other dukes elsewhere in the castle she leaves alone but oelph opts to follow her in secret he arrives in time to see her stumble across the body of a murdered duke stabbed with one of her scalpels and catches a glimpse of the real murderer fleeing the room vosill and oelph are almost immediately taken into custody by guards and delivered to ralinge who binds the two to separately and then strips intending to rape vosill the woman issues what sounds to oelph like commands albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially oelphs eyes are closed at this point and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next other than an impression of wind and metal when he opens his eyes he finds ralinge and his assistants dead dispatched bloodily and vosill free and in the process of removing his bindings no indication of how she was freed later she claims that oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first though she indicates to him that this is what he should remember the two are taken from the torturers chamber shortly thereafter as the king has abruptly taken ill and appears to be dying vosill is able to cure king quiences condition and is there to witness as the conspiracy against her is revealed to the king inadvertently when news of ralinges death reaches the conspirators commander adlain and dukes quettil and ulresile ultimately the blame is publicly taken by ulresile who escapes with being exiled for several months the king makes it clear that further plots against the doctor will not be tolerated because oelph is not present for these events his account comes second hand from his master revealed to be guard commander adlain vosill requests the king release her from her duties which he does she leaves just a few days later on a ship for drezen and is seen off at the dock by oelph though he tries he cannot bring himself to bluntly declare his love for her before she boards the ship leaves sometime later vosill nowhere to be seen on board the second interleaved storyline is told by an initially unnamed narrator remaining unnamed so as to provide a neutral context for the narrative the story focuses on dewar bodyguard to general urleyn the prime protector of the protectorate of tassasen protector urleyn is the leader of tassasen having killed the previous monarch in a revolt subsequently he eliminated official terms such as king and empire within tassasen at the beginning of the story the protectorate is fast approaching a war with the neighboring land of ladenscion led by barons who initially supported urleyns revolution but now intend to establish themselves as independent dewar is the sometimes confidant of urleyn but the bodyguard also maintains a friendly conversational relationship with perrund a member of the tassasen harem perrund was once the protectors prized concubine which changed following an assassination attempt on urleyn perrund shielded the protector with her body saving his life at the cost of crippling her left arm though no longer as prized as a concubine perrund is highly regarded by urleyn dewar and most of tassasen society dewar in particular finds her easy to confide in and spends much of his off time playing board games with her while the two tell each other stories dewar is on high alert as the conflict with ladenscion approaches believing that someone within the court may be a traitor an attempt is made on urleyns life by an assassin disguised as an ambassador though dewar anticipates the threat and kills the man before he can succeed nonetheless this act only reinforces dewars fears of a traitor a surprising unwelcome turn comes when urleyns young son lattens has a seizure and subsequently falls ill while the boy slowly recovers dewar tells him stories of a magical land called lavishia a place where every man was a king every woman a queen eventually the boy recovers and urleyn and his bodyguard depart for the front lines where the war with ladenscion is flagging however no sooner they are there than word arrives that lattens has fallen ill again prompting a distraught urleyn to rush back to the castle while dewar is gone perrund tells lattens a story about a girl named dawn who spent most of her life locked in a basement by her cruel family and was eventually rescued by a traveling circus when he returns perrund tells dewar about the story then tells him it was a shadow of the real story her story rather than her parents locking her in the basement to be cruel they locked her in to hide her from imperial soldiers high ranking men of the former kings regime rather than being rescued the soldiers found her raped her her mother and her sisters and then forced her to watch as they murdered her father and brothers the soldiers were eventually killed but perrund still feels she is now dead inside dewar attempts to in some way comfort her but she quickly demands he return her to the harem lattens condition continues to worsen causing urleyn to act more and more erratically spending less time focusing on the war and more time at his sons bedside the protector goes so far as to bar all visitors to his chambers and even prohibits dewar from speaking to him unless he is spoken to his only real contact is with perrund who spends most nights holding urleyn as he cries himself to sleep dewar enlists perrunds help in focusing urleyn on the war but to no success an epiphany strikes dewar when he finds he has drooled on his pillow in his sleep and he proceeds to lattens room a guard restrains the boys nurse while dewar examines his comforter finding it has been soaked in an unknown fluid presumably poison under threat of death the nurse reveals who has been orchestrating the poisoning perrund dewar storms into the harem chambers intent on revealing the conspiracy to urleyn but arrives too late perrund has already killed the protector and calmly waits for the bodyguard holding her at swordpoint dewar tearfully demands to know why she conspired against the protector perrund replies that she did it for revenge for killing her and her family the soldiers who raped her were not the former kings men at all not even men allied to urleyn but the man himself as well as his current closest advisers afterward she was taken in by men from haspidus and recruited as a spy by king quience directly saving urleyn from the assassin was simply to prevent him from dying while he was a strong leader instead her orders were to ensure he died in utter ruin after her confession perrund demands dewar kill her he silently refuses lowering his sword perrund grabs his knife and brings it to her own throat but it is quickly knocked away by dewars blade which he lowers once more oelph gives a brief personal epilogue for both stories the three conspirators who attempted to kill vosill died of various diseases only adlain lasting longer than a few years king quience reigned for years before his death and was succeeded by one of his many daughters giving the kingdom its first ruling queen vosill disappeared from the ship she departed on her disappearance was only discovered after a sudden burst of wind and chain fire struck the ship then vanished as quickly attempts to notify vosills family in drezen were unsuccessful nobody in the island country could be found who had ever met her oelph himself became a doctor eventually taking vosills post as the royal physician tassasen endured a civil war after the death of protector urleyn eventually king lattens took control of the empire ruling it quietly oelph explains that he stopped dewars story as he did because that is where versions of the story differ dramatically the more popular version has dewar personally execute perrund followed by a return to the half hidden kingdoms where he reclaims his hidden title as prince and eventually king a second version supposedly written by perrund herself instead has dewar telling the waiting guards and staff that urleyn is fine but sleeping this and other distractions providing enough time for him and the former concubine to flee tassasen before the protectors body is discovered the two elude capture and arrive in the half hidden kingdoms eventually marry have several children and die many years later in an avalanche in the mountains finally oelph ends his epilogue by revealing that he expects his wife whom he loves dearly to return soon quite possibly with his grandchildren accompanying her

Foundation's Edge,Isaac Asimov,five hundred years after the establishment of the foundation the mayor of terminus harla branno is basking in a political glow her policies having been vindicated by the recent successful resolution of a seldon crisis golan trevize a former officer of the navy and now a member of council believes the second foundation which is almost universally thought to be extinct still exists and is controlling events he attempts to question the continued existence of the seldon plan during a council session and branno has him arrested on a charge of treason she orders him to leave terminus to search for the second foundation as a cover he is to be accompanied by janov pelorat a professor of ancient history and mythologist who is interested in the location of earth the fabled homeworld of humanity they are provided a highly advanced computer controlled gravitic ship with which to carry out their mission branno also sends out munn li compor in another similar vessel to follow and monitor trevize on trantor stor gendibal a rising intellect in the second foundation hierarchy discovers a secret he reveals to quindor shandess the current first speaker mdash that the seldon plan which the second foundation diligently protects and furthers along is being manipulated by some unknown group one possibly more powerful than the second foundation and whose reasons for so doing are not known this group is dubbed the anti mules by shandess as they seem to possess powers similar to the mule but to be using them not to destroy the seldon plan as the mule did but to preserve it gendibal concludes that trevize is a lightning rod sent out to locate and expose the second foundation his ideas are not well received by the other speakers but he has the support of shandess trevize never intends to go to trantor believing that once at the library pelorat will never leave trevize and pelorat discuss pelorats interest in earth and its legends and trevize realizes that seldons phrase at the other end of the galaxy the phrase he used to describe the second foundations location could mean earth his logic being that terminus at the time of hari seldon was the last planet to be inhabited one end of the metaphorical galaxy and by definition earth was the first the other end of the metaphorical galaxy however there is no planet named earth in the galactic table of planets pelorat through his previous research established characteristics that earth must have a hour day a day year and a large satellite once again no planet on file has these characteristics but the galactic table of planets is missing a lot of information about a lot of planets nonetheless pelorat has a guess the table mentions a planet called gaia which pelorat discovered previously to mean earth its exact coordinates are unknown but it is listed as being in the sayshell sector trevize decides that they must go to the sayshell sector to follow up on this lead gendibal demonstrates to the speakers table that the brain of sura novi a hamishwoman the farming population of trantor are known as the hamish shows a very subtle change in her mind that could only have been done by an agency more powerful than the second foundation he believes it was done by the anti mules and that they have a separate agenda with the second foundation as their unwitting pawn gendibal and novi are sent to track trevize and to determine the goals of the anti mules on sayshell trevize and pelorat meet professor quintesetz who is able to give them the co ordinates to the mysterious planet known as gaia traveling to gaia they discover that it is a superorganism where all things both living and inanimate participate in a larger group consciousness while still retaining any individual awareness they might have such as among the gaian humans pelorat slowly falls in love with a gaian woman named blissenobiarella commonly called bliss who explains that trevize will be forced to decide the future of the galaxy mdash whether it will be ruled by the first foundation the second foundation or by gaia who envisions an eventual extension of its group consciousness to the entire galaxy thus forming the new entity galaxia gendibal is met by a first foundation warship commanded by mayor branno as gendibals mental powers stalemate with mayor brannos force shield novi reveals herself as an agent of gaia once she joins the stalemate the three are locked until trevize can join them bliss explains to trevize that he had been led to gaia so that his untouched mind a mind with remarkable intuition can decide the galaxys fate he also learns that the stalemate between the first foundation branno the second foundation gendibal and gaia novi was intentional and that through the ships computer he can decide who shall ultimately prove victorious trevize decides upon gaia and through mental adjustments gaia makes branno and gendibal believe they have won minor victories and that gaia does not exist but trevize is troubled by one final piece of missing information who or what has removed all reference to earth from the galactic library at trantor and why he announces his intention to find earth since without knowing the answers to those questions he cannot be certain his choice was the right one trevize also mentions that he chose gaia because that was the only choice of the three that was not irreversible in case his choice should prove to be wrong due to the large length of time required for the formation of galaxia

Prelude to Foundation,Isaac Asimov,the story takes place on trantor during the reign of emperor cleon i it starts with haris presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically be possible the emperor of the galactic empire learns of this and wants to use hari for political gain after an interview with hari however cleon concludes that hari is of no use to the empire hari then meets reporter chetter hummin who convinces him that cleons first minister eto demerzel is attempting to capture him and that it is therefore imperative for hari to escape and to try to make psychohistory practical thus hari goes on his flight and is introduced to dors venabili by hummin hari and dors narrowly evade capture at streeling university following which the pair move to mycogen hari and dors are welcomed to mycogen by sunmaster fourteen the leader of mycogen determined to work out his psychohistory with the knowledge that the mycogenians supposedly possess hari decides to speak to a mycogenian alone about history he manages this by convincing raindrop forty three to show him the prized mycogenian microfarms a prized source of food for the aristocracy and mycogenians alike when hari inquires about that the peculiar mycogenian ways might be the product of religious belief raindrop forty three is offended and says that the mycogenians have something better history hari inquires into the source of mycogenian history and raindrop forty three reveals that it is encompassed in the book hari asks for the book but raindrop forty three accepts on the condition that hari allows her to touch his hair hair being expressively forbidden in mycogenian society when hari starts reading the book he finds it disappointing except for the revealing of what the mycogenians call their home planet aurora hari and dors are almost killed when they try to find what they suspect is a robot in the mycogenian temple until hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them the action then shifts to the dahl sector where dors displays her amazing knife fighting skills while in dahl they meet a guttersnipe named raych whom hari later adopts as his son and yugo amaryl who would become haris partner in developing psychohistory towards the end of the novel hari dors and raych are kidnapped by agents from wye a powerful sector situated at trantors south pole the finale reveals that hummin is actually cleons first minister eto demerzel who we later learn is in fact the robot r daneel olivaw by the end of the novel hari suspects that dors is a robot too this theme would later be picked up in forward the foundation
Foundation and Earth,Isaac Asimov,councilman golan trevize historian janov pelorat and blissenobiarella of the planet gaia all of whom were introduced in foundations edge set out on a journey to find humanitys ancestral planet mdash earth the purpose of the journey is to settle trevizes doubt with his decision at the end of foundations edge to embrace the all encompassing supermind of galaxia first they journey to comporellon which claims to be the oldest currently inhabited planet in the galaxy although many other planets make that claim comporellon has a very long history with which to back it up upon arrival they are imprisoned but negotiate their way out while there they find the coordinates of three spacer planets since the spacers were the first colonists from earth back in the ancient days of space travel it is surmised that their planets would be fairly close to earth the first spacer planet they visit is aurora where trevize is nearly killed by a pack of wild dogs presumed to be the descendants of household pets long since reverted to wolf like savagery they escape when bliss manipulates the dogs emotions to psychologically compel a retreat while trevize uses his neuronic whip on them next they go to solaria where they find that the solarians who have survived the spacer settler conflicts by clever retreat detailed in asimovs novel robots and empire have engineered themselves into self reproducing hermaphrodite beings who have remained generally intolerant of human physical presence or contact they have also given themselves a natural ability to mentally channel transduce great amounts of energy and utilize this as their sole source of power the solarians intentionally avoid ever having to interact with each other except by holographic apparatus viewing and reproduce only when necessary to replace someone who has died bliss pelorat and trevize are nearly killed by a solarian named sarton bander bliss however deflects the transducer brain lobes at the moment bander tries to use them to kill bliss intends to knock out bander but has not had sufficient time to learn the full workings of the transducer and accidentally kills it instead while escaping they find what they assume to be banders immature child fallom in a state of panic because its robotic nursemaid like all other robots on the estate has stopped functioning the child fallom cannot inherit the bander estate as would normally be the solarian custom because it is too immature to be able to use its transducer lobes there being no other place for the child on solaria the decision of the robots who immediately arrive to investigate the loss of power is that fallom is to be destroyed upon learning this bliss insists that they take fallom with them they next go to melpomenia the third and final spacer coordinate they have they find that the atmosphere has become depressurized to a few thousandths of normal atmospheric pressure wearing space suits they enter a library and find a statue as well as writings with the coordinates of all of the spacer worlds while departing melpomenia they notice a carbon dioxide feeding moss has begun feeding off insignificant leakages in their space suits barely recognizing this before stepping on their fully pressurized ship mdash which would have likely been disastrous mdash they set their blasters to minimum power to fry it off and then set the ship to heavy uv illumination before stepping on board this disinfection procedure kills any trace of the moss preventing it from spreading to other worlds as well as giving them another spacer worlds that they could visit they now have a vital clue to where earth may be found since the spacer worlds were settled from earth they form a rough sphere with earth at the centre two stars seem to match one is a binary star and also on the charts as an inhabited world though with a question mark where its status should be indicated the other is uncharted and much more likely to be earths star especially since legends do not mention earth being part of a binary system they decide however to go first to the binary system because it may give them clues about what to expect on earth itself they next journey to the enigmatic charted system which turns out to be alpha centauri they find a remnant of the inhabitants of earth who many millennia ago were resettled there there is a reference back to the events of asimovs novel pebble in the sky we learn that the restoration of earths soil was indeed attempted but was abandoned later with earth becoming uninhabitable there was a grand project to terraform alpha this too was not completed the only dry land is an island kilometers long and kilometers wide it is left open whether or not the entire population of the dying earth was sent to alpha the natives who call their home new earth are quite friendly and bliss trevize pelorat and fallom decide to enjoy some rest and relaxation it turns out that the natives secretly intend to kill them so as to prevent them from ever informing the rest of the galaxy of new earth the natives are paranoid of being taken by another empire of any kind they are warned by a native woman who becomes sympathetic upon hearing fallom playing the flute with its transducer brain lobes and make their escape in the middle of the night now certain that alpha centauri is not earth but is near earth they head towards the uncharted system they do notice and are puzzled by the very strong similarities between this star and the larger sun of the alpha centauri system asimov here is drawing attention to an astronomical curio the nearest star system to sol contains a star that has the same spectral type g v though alpha centauri a is a little larger and brighter entering the solar system of the uncharted star they notice that it fits legends about earths solar system the sixth planet has very prominent rings much more so than any known gas giant also the third planet the one fit for life possesses an abnormally large moon for any planet other than a gas giant obviously this is earth and its solar system on the approach to earth they detect that it is highly radioactive and not capable of supporting life but while trying to use the ships computer to locate solaria fallom calls trevizes attention upon the moon which is big enough to serve as a hideout for the forces that lived on earth they land on there and find r daneel olivaw who explains that he has been paternalistically manipulating humanity for many millennia and indeed since elijah baleys time which was long before the galactic empire or foundation he caused the settlement of alpha centauri the creation of gaia and the creation of psychohistory detailed in prelude to foundation and forward the foundation he also manipulated trevize into making his decision at the end of foundations edge although he did not manipulate the decision itself trevize confirms that decision as the numerous narrow escapes have convinced him that the creation of galaxia is the correct choice also daneels positronic brain is deteriorating he explains that he is unable to design a new brain as it would require extreme miniaturization to the point where the brain would deteriorate immediately thus he tells his visitors that he wishes to merge falloms brain with his own as falloms life span is the exceptionally long one of a spacer this will buy him time to oversee galaxias creation daneel continues to explain that since the dawn of civilization man has been divided this was the reason for his causing the creation of psychohistory and gaia another reason this was important was because of the likelihood of advanced life beyond the galaxy eventually attacking humanity this danger is part of the conclusion to asimovs book the end of eternity in which project eternity which manipulated human history to maintain human comfort had to be destroyed to undo that same extraterrestrial

Ishmael,Daniel Quinn,ishmael begins with a newspaper ad teacher seeks pupil must have an earnest desire to save the world apply in person the nameless narrator and protagonist begins his story telling how he first reacted to this ad with scorn because of the absurdity of wanting to save the world a notion he feels that once he foolishly embraced himself as an adolescent during the counterculture movement of the s however he responds to the ad anyway and upon arriving at the address finds himself in a room with a gorilla he notices a polysemous sign that reads with man gone will there be hope for gorilla to the narrators surprise he finds that the gorilla calling himself ishmael can communicate telepathically at first baffled by this the man learns the story of how the gorilla came to be here and soon accepts ishmael as his teacher regularly returning to ishmaels office throughout the plot the novel continues from this point mainly as a socratic dialogue between ishmael and his new student as they hash out what ishmael refers to as how things came to be this way for mankind ishmaels life which began in the african wilderness was spent mostly in a zoo and a menagerie and since had been spent in the gazebo of a man that extricated him from physical captivity he tells his student that it was at the menagerie that he learned about human language and culture and began to think about things that he never would have pondered in the wild subsequently ishmael tells his student that the subject for this learning experience will be captivity primarily the captivity of man under a distorted civilizational system the narrator claims to ishmael that he has a vague notion of living in some sort of cultural captivity and being lied to in some way but he can not explain his feelings before proceeding ishmael lays some ground definitions for his student he defines takers as people often referred to as civilized particularly the culture born in an agricultural revolution that began about years ago in the near east this is the culture of ishmaels pupil and presumably the reader leavers as people of all other cultures often derogatorily referred to by takers as primitive a story as an interrelation between the gods man and the earth with a beginning middle and end to enact is to strive to make a story come true a culture is a people who are enacting a story ishmael proceeds to tease from his pupil the premises of the story i e myth being enacted by the takers that they are the pinnacle of evolution that the world was made for man and that man is here to conquer and rule the world this rule is meant to bring about a paradise as man increases his mastery of the world however he is always failing because he is flawed man doesnt know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable so however hard he labors to save the world he is just going to go on defiling and spoiling it ishmael points out to his student that when the takers decided there is something fundamentally wrong with humans they took as evidence only their own cultures history they were looking at a half of one percent of the evidence taken from a single culture not a reasonable sample on which to base such a sweeping conclusion ishmael says theres nothing fundamentally wrong with people given a story to enact that puts them in accord with the world they will live in accord with the world but given a story to enact that puts them at odds with the world as yours does they will live at odds with the world given a story to enact in which they are the lords of the world they will act as the lords of the world and given a story to enact in which the world is a foe to be conquered they will conquer it like a foe and one day inevitably their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet as the world is now ishmael goes on to help his student discover that contrary to what the takers think there are immutable laws that life is subject to and it is possible to discern them by studying the biological community together ishmael and his student identify one set of survival strategies which appear to be evolutionarily stable for all species later dubbed the law of limited competition in short you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or deny them access to food in other words you may compete but you may not wage war all species inevitably follow this law or as a consequence go extinct the takers believe themselves to be exempt from this law and flout it at every point ishmael explains how the takers rendered themselves above the laws governing life using the story of the fall of man as an example his version of why the fruit was forbidden to adam and eve in the garden of eden is eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil provides the gods with the knowledge of who shall live and who shall die knowledge which they need to rule the world the fruit nourishes only the gods though if adam man were to eat from this tree he might think that he gained the gods wisdom without this actually happening and consequently destroy the world and himself through his arrogance and so they said to him you may eat of every tree in the garden save the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for on the day you eat of that tree you will certainly die ishmael makes the point that this story of the fall of man which the takers have adopted as their own was in fact developed by leavers to explain the origin of the takers if it were of taker origin the story would be of liberating ascent instead of a sinful fall ishmael and his student go on to discuss how for the ancient semitic herders among whom the tale originated the story of cain killing abel symbolizes the leaver being killed off and their lands taken so that it could be put under cultivation these ancient herders realized that the takers were acting as if they were gods themselves with all the wisdom of what is good and evil and how to rule the world and as a result the gods banished these people from the garden and they were brought from a life of bounty in the hands of the gods to one of being the accursed tillers of the soil to begin discerning the leavers story ishmael proposes to his student a hypothesis the takers agricultural revolution was a revolution against the leavers story the leavers take what they need from the world and leave the rest alone living in this manner in the hands of the gods leavers thrive in times of abundance and dwindle in times of scarcity the takers however practicing their unique form of agriculture dubbed by quinn totalitarian agriculture produce enormous food surpluses which allows them to thwart the gods when they decide it s the takers time to go hungry when you have more food than you need then the gods have no power over you thus ishmael points out that the takers revolution was not just a technological change but also serves a mythological function so we have a new pair of names for you the takers are those who know good and evil and the leavers are those who live in the hands of the gods ishmael goes on to point out that by living in the hands of the gods man is subject to the conditions under which evolution takes place australopithecus became homo by living in the hands of the gods man became man by living in the hands of the gods by living the way the bushmen of africa live by living the way the krenakarore of brazil live not the way the chicagoans live not the way londoners live in the hands of the gods is where evolution happens according to the takers story creation came to an end with man in order to make their story come true the takers have to put an end to creation itself and they re doing a damn good job of it ishmael brings together his synopsis on human culture by examining the story enacted by leaver cultures which provides a model of how to live an alternative story for the takers to enact the premise of the takers story is the world belongs to man the premise of the leavers story is man belongs to the world for three million years man belonged to the world and because he belonged to the world he grew and developed and became brighter and more dexterous until one day he was so bright and so dexterous that we had to call him homo sapiens sapiens which means he was us the leavers story is the gods made man for the world the same way they made salmon and sparrows for the world this seems to have worked well so far so we can take it easy and leave the running of the world to the gods ishmael emphasizes that not in any sense is the takers story chapter two of the story which was being enacted here during the first three million years of human life the leavers story has its own chapter two in evolution observes ishmael s student there seems to be a tendency toward complexity and towards self awareness and intelligence perhaps the gods intend the world to be filled with intelligent self aware creatures and man s destiny following the leavers story is to be the first without being the last to learn and then to be a role model and teacher for all those capable of becoming what he s become ishmael finishes with a summary of what his student can do if he earnestly desires to save the world the story of genesis must be undone first cain must stop murdering abel this is essential if youre to survive the leavers are the endangered species most critical to the world not because theyre humans but because they alone can show the destroyers of the world that there is more than one right way to live and then of course you must spit out the fruit of the forbidden tree you must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who should live and who should die on this planet teach a hundred what ive taught you and inspire each of them to teach a hundred the student loses track of ishmael s whereabouts and in his search for the gorilla ultimately discovers that he was secretly falling ill and has since died of pneumonia when the student goes back to ishmael s office he finds the sign that he saw before with man gone will there be hope for gorilla has a backside the back contains another message with gorilla gone will there be hope for man

Clarke,the novel is divided into three parts following a third person omniscient narrative with no main character in the late th century the united states and the soviet union are competing to launch the first spaceship into orbit to military ends however when vast alien spaceships suddenly position themselves above earths principal cities the space race is halted forever after one week the aliens announce they are assuming supervision of international affairs to prevent humanitys extinction as the overlords they bring peace and they claim that interference will be limited they interfere only twice with human affairs in south africa where sometime before their arrival apartheid had collapsed and was replaced with savage persecution of the white minority and in spain where they put an end to bull fighting some humans are suspicious of the overlords benign intent as they never appear in physical form overlord karellen the supervisor for earth speaks directly only to rikki stormgren the finnish un secretary general karellen tells stormgren that the overlords will reveal themselves in years when humanity will have become used to their presence stormgren smuggles a device onto karellens ship in an attempt to see karellens true form he succeeds is shocked and chooses to keep silent humankind enters a golden age of prosperity at the expense of creativity as promised five decades after their arrival the overlords appear for the first time they resemble the traditional human folk images of demons large bipeds with leathery wings horns and tails the overlords are interested in psychic research which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study rupert boyce a prolific book collector on the subject allows one overlord rashaverak to study these books at his home to impress his friends with rashaveraks presence boyce holds a party during which he makes use of a ouija board an astrophysicist jan rodricks asks the identity of the overlords home star george greggsons wife jean faints as the ouija board reveals a star catalog number confirming the direction in which overlord supply ships appear and disappear jan rodricks stows away on an overlord supply ship and travels light years to their home planet due to the time dilation of special relativity at near light speeds the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks and he arranges to endure it in drug induced suspended animation although humanity and the overlords have peaceful relations some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant these groups establish new athens an island colony devoted to the creative arts which george and jean greggson join the overlords conceal a special interest in the greggsons children jeffrey and jennifer anne and intervene to save jeffreys life when a tsunami strikes the island the overlords have been watching them since the incident with the ouija board which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within jean sixty years after the overlords arrival human children including the greggsons begin to display telekinetic powers karellen reveals the overlords purpose they serve the overmind a vast cosmic intelligence born of amalgamated ancient civilizations and freed from the limitations of material existence yet the overlords themselves are strangely unable to join the overmind but serve it as a bridge species charged with fostering other races eventual merger with it because of this karellen expresses his envy of humanity for the transformed childrens safety they are segregated on a continent of their own no more human children are born and many parents find their lives stripped of meaning and die or commit suicide new athens is destroyed by its members with a nuclear bomb jan rodricks emerges from hibernation on the overlord supply ship and arrives on their planet the overlords permit him a glimpse of how the overmind communicates with them when jan returns to earth approximately years later by earth time he finds an unexpectedly altered planet humanity has effectively become extinct and he is now the last man alive hundreds of millions of children no longer fitting with what rodricks defines as human remain on the quarantined continent barely moving with eyes closed and communicating by telepathy they are the penultimate form of human evolution having become a single group mind readying themselves to join the overmind some overlords remain on earth to study the children from a safe distance when the evolved children mentally alter the moons rotation and make other planetary manipulations it becomes too dangerous to remain the departing overlords offer to take rodricks with them but he chooses to stay to witness earths end and transmits a report of what he sees the overlords are eager to escape from their own evolutionary dead end by studying the overmind so rodricks information is potentially of great value to them by radio rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet as the column disappears rodricks experiences a profound sense of emptiness when the overlords have gone then material objects and the earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency jan reports no fear but a powerful sense of fulfillment the earth evaporates in a flash of light karellen looks back at the receding solar system and gives a final salute to the human species

world has a few things in common with our own however including memories of the song hey jude and the childs rhyme that begins beans beans the musical fruit vestiges of forgotten or skewed versions of real world technology also appear such as a reference to a gas pump that is worshipped as a god named amoco and an abandoned way station with a water pump which is powered by an atomic slug as roland travels across the desert with his mule in search of the man in black he encounters brown a farmer and zoltan his crow who graciously offers to put him up for the night while he is there we learn of

turned her against roland she turns the entire town on roland men women and children in order to escape with his life roland is forced to kill every resident of the town including his lover allie

space cowboy after a line from a steve miller song the joker a combination of panic and thirst eventually causes jessie to hallucinate she hears voices in her head each one ostensibly the voice of a person in her life primarily the goodwife or goody burlingame a somewhat puritanical version of jessie ruth neary an old college friend and nora callighan her ex psychiatrist both of whom jessie hasnt spoken to in decades these voices represent different parts of her personality which help her extract a painful childhood memory she has kept suppressed for many years she was sexually abused by her

geralds paycheck by being a trophy wife without children this internal dialogue is mixed with descriptions of jessies more and more desperate attempts to get out of the handcuffs first by trying to break the headboard she was cuffed to then by trying to slip off the bed and push the bed to the bureau where the keys were placed finally she does escape after one of the voices in her head tells her that if she stays another night the space cowboy who she dreamed of as a manifestation of death will more than likely take a part of her to add to its trophy fishing creel filled with jewelry and human bones killing her in the process jessie escapes the handcuffs by slicing her arm open all the way around on a broken glass and giving herself a degloving injury in order to lubricate her skin enough for the cuffs which were made for men and not women and thus almost loose enough for her to slip out normally to slide off her right hand she is then able to move behind the bed push it over to

ticketed the meaning of this term is intentionally kept vague at first but it soon becomes clear that buying a ticket means to be shot dead by soldiers riding in half tracks along the roadside walkers may be shot immediately for certain serious violations such as trying to leave the road or attacking the half track the soldiers use electronic equipment to precisely determine a walkers speed the event is run by a character known as the major who is implied to have much power stemming from a possible military or fascist state system the major appears at the beginning of the walk to encourage the boys and start them on their way and then occasionally thereafter while the walkers initially greet him with awe and respect they eventually realize their admiration is misplaced and ridicule him

any time and new food supplies are distributed at every morning walkers may bring anything they can carry including food or additional footwear but cannot receive aid from bystanders they are allowed to have bodily contact with onlookers as long as they stay on the road while they cannot physically interfere with one another to detrimental effect they can help each other provided they stay above four miles per hour the winner receives the prize anything he wants for the rest of his life it is implied that many past winners have died soon after the walk due to its hazardous mental and physical

distracted long enough to drop a warning saving his life after five days and hundreds of miles the walk eventually comes down to garraty and stebbins who revealed to garraty and mcvries earlier that day that he is the illegitimate son of the major stebbins states he used to think the major was unaware of his existence but it turns out that the major has numerous illegitimate children nationwide four years earlier the major took stebbins to the finish of a long walk and now stebbins feels that the major has set him up to be the rabbit motivating other runners to walk farther to prolong the

walk in history the long walkers reached massachusetts for the first time in seventeen years garraty decides to give up after realizing that stebbins has shown almost no weaknesses over the duration

run
Solaris,Stanisław Lem,solaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life on a far distant planet solaris with whom terran scientists are attempting communication is almost completely covered with an ocean that is revealed to be a single planet encompassing organism what appear to be waves on its surface are later revealed to be the equivalents of muscle contractions kris kelvin arrives aboard the scientific research station hovering via anti gravity generators near the oceanic surface of the planet solaris the scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for many decades a scientific discipline known as solaristics which over the years has degenerated to simply observe record and categorize the complex phenomena that occur upon the surface of the ocean thus far they have only achieved the formal classification of the phenomena with an elaborate nomenclature yet do not understand what such activities really mean in a strictly scientific sense shortly before psychologist kelvins arrival the crew has exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation with a high energy x ray bombardment their experimentation gives unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as individually flawed humans the oceans response to their aggression exposes the deeper hidden aspects of the personalities of the human scientists whilst revealing nothing of the ocean s nature itself to the extent that the ocean s actions can be understood the ocean then seems to test the minds of the scientists by confronting them with their most painful and repressed thoughts and memories it does this via the materialization of physical human simulacra kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide the torments of the other researchers are only alluded to but seem even worse than kelvin s personal purgatory the ocean s intelligence expresses physical phenomena in ways difficult for their limited earth science to explain deeply upsetting the scientists the alien extraterrestrial mind of solaris is so greatly different from the human mind of objective consciousness that attempts at inter species communications are a dismal failure

Excession,Iain Banks,the excession of the title is a perfect black body sphere that appears mysteriously on the edge of culture space appears to be older than the universe itself and resists the attempts of the culture and technologically equivalent societies notably the zetetic elench to probe it the excession is what the cultures social scientists describe as an outside context problem one which a society cannot foresee and is often fatal a metaphor to help explain this phrase is that of a successful aboriginal culture suddenly finding ocean going vessels on its shores for the first time a group of stereotypical bureaucrats tries to manage the cultures response to the excession but is brushed aside by the interesting times gang an informal group of minds some of whom are veterans of the idiran culture war to try to deal with what is by far the most serious challenge the culture has faced meanwhile a rapidly expanding race which the culture calls the affront because of its systematic sadism towards subject species and its own females and junior males despite being relatively advanced tries to exploit the excession by infiltrating a store of mothballed culture warships and using them to claim control of the mysterious object it turns out that the affront have been manipulated into their grab for power by another culture faction which thought it was morally imperative to curb the affronts cruelty by any means and intend to use the affronts theft of culture warships as an excuse for war the gsv sleeper service eventually takes control of the situation its name is the most meaningful pun in the story outwardly it is an eccentric drop out from the culture which dedicates its enormous resources to presenting tableaux of historical events mainly battles populated by passengers in suspended animation but in fact it is a sleeping member of special circumstances the cultures covert operations organization the name of sleeper service is thus double pronged it is a sleeper service to human beings in storage and a sleeper service within sc as it has produced a massive war fleet during the year period it has spent behaving as an eccentric it prepares to deploy this fleet during transit to the excession but sleeper service has an unresolved issue until a few decades previously the ship operated under another name as a normal gsv providing a habitat for a vast number of culture citizens two of its passengers dajeil and genar hofoen had had an intense love affair which ended badly when genar hofoen was unfaithful and a pregnant dajeil tried to kill genar hofoen but only succeeded in the feticide of the child with which genar hofoen was pregnant after the break up dajeil froze her pregnancy and subsequently remained in a state of intense depression for years and the ship changed its name to sleeper service and started acting as an eccentric it carried only one conscious humanoid passenger dajeil and spent much of its attention trying to talk her out of her depression for which it considered itself partly responsible as a result when the culture asks sleeper service to help in dealing with the threat of war the ship demands that in return genar hofoen must be handed over to it genar hofoen is lured to sleeper service on a pretext and only later told that he is there to work with dajeil to help her recover from her psychological trauma sleeper service then unloads the passengers who had been part of its historical tableaux having spent much of its eccentric decades converting a large percentage of the mass of the tableaux scenery into engines it easily outruns the very fast ship which other elements of the culture had asked to keep watch on it once it is beyond the watching ships sensor range sleeper service changes course and heads towards the excession when it arrives it becomes apparent it has previously converted the rest of its spare mass into a vast fleet of remote controlled warships numbering in the area of units the excession in response to the sleeper charging at it then triggers a multi light year gridfire wave which threatens to obliterate it and its entire fleet along with the accompanying grey area only its mindstate transmitted right at the excession saves it by convincing the excession to halt its attack the minds controlling the ships which the affront stole from the mothball find themselves outnumbered more than and refuse to help the affront the affront fleets commander and the culture ship which led the conspiracy commit suicide a prolonged war is thus averted at the same time the excession disappears as mysteriously as it arrived meanwhile the rush of events combined with a conversation with genar hofoen results in dajeil moving out of her depression and completing her pregnancy genar hofoen returns to the affront having been rewarded by being physically transformed into a member of the affront species whose company he finds more stimulating than that of the cultures people the books epilogue reveals that the excession is a sentient entity which is currently acting as a bridge for a procession of even higher beings which travel between universes it also assesses whether the species and societies it encounters are suitable to be enlightened about some unknown further existence beyond the universe as a result of events in the story the excession concludes that the civilisations it has encountered in our universe are not ready for this enlightenment and moves on so that it will not cause any further disturbance hence its disappearance at the end of the book it also takes the name given to it by the culture excession as its own outside context proble

Use of Weapons,Iain Banks,the book is made up of two narrative streams interwoven in alternating chapters the numbers of the chapters indicate which stream they belong to one stream is numbered forward in words one two while the other is numbered in reverse with roman numerals xiii xii the story told by the former moves forward chronologically as the numbers suggest and tells a self contained story while in the latter is written in reverse chronology with each chapter successively earlier in zakalwes life further complicating this structure is a prologue and epilogue set shortly after the events of the main narrative and many flashbacks within the chapters the forward moving stream of the novel deals with the attempts of diziet sma and a drone named skaffen amtiskaw to re enlist zakalwe for another job the task itself and the payment that zakalwe wishes for it the backward moving stream describes earlier jobs that zakalwe has performed for the culture ultimately returning to his pre culture career as a general on his homeworld it transpires that the payment he requires from sma relates to an incident from his earlier life

"I, the Jury",Mickey Spillane,new york city summer although she runs a successful private psychiatric clinic on new yorks park avenue dr charlotte manning mdash young beautiful blonde and well to do mdash cannot get enough in order to increase her profit she gets involved with a group of criminals mdash a syndicate mdash specialising in both prostitution and drug trafficking the brains of the outfit is hal kines who has had plastic surgery so that he looks much younger than he really is this being how he gets hold of the young women whom he then turns into prostitutes manning herself has a rich and ritzy clientele mdash people who would not want their addiction to become public knowledge but instead of weaning them off drugs in her private and exclusive clinic manning makes them even more dependent on both the drug mdash heroin in most cases mdash and on herself by procuring the stuff herself on the surface charlotte manning keeps up appearances and leads a respectable life as a renowned psychiatrist when jack williams a former new york cop who has lost an arm in world war ii saving his friend mike hammers life falls in love with myrna devlin a young heroin addict whom he stops from jumping off a bridge to commit suicide he asks manning to admit her to her clinic for psychotherapy after myrna has become clean she and williams become engaged and the couple keep up a casual friendship with charlotte manning this is how williamss growing suspicions about mannings business lead him to privately and secretly investigate even further into the matter when he realizes that hal kines one of mannings college students who has spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual acquaintances is in fact a criminal he wants to talk to her about it and tells her so when at a party given by williams in his apartment charlotte manning sees some old college yearbooks whose contents and photos if made public would expose kiness double life she has to act fast after the party she goes home but on the same night undetected by kathy her maid goes back to williamss apartment myrna his fianc e does not live there and shoots him in the stomach using a silencer she does so in a particularly sadistic way watching him die slowly then she takes the college yearbooks and leaves none of the guests at williamss party has a watertight alibi but to both pat chambers the cop investigating the murder and mike hammer a friend of his and private investigator none of them has a motive either throughout the book as more and more immediate suspects are eliminated shot if this kept up there wouldnt be anyone left at all hammer briefly ponders the question if the killer could be an outsider mdash someone wholly unrelated to the group of people who have been at williamss party for example someone williams was after in his capacity as investigator for an insurance company chambers also thinks along similar lines williamss secret connection with myrnas former drug dealers might have cost him his life but they soon abandon that theory when mike hammer sees williamss body for the first time in my life i felt like crying he makes a solemn vow he promises that he will find the murderer and execute him himself avoiding the u s judicial system altogether he says that if he left it to the courts to punish the perpetrator some clever lawyer would surely achieve an acquittal and the murderer would get away with his crime this is why he himself will be the jury ndash and the judge for that matter throughout their basically separate investigations hammer and chambers work closely together exchanging information and evidence but each of them hopes he will be the one to find the killer in the end the immediate suspects hammer finds himself confronted with are esther and mary bellemy identical twins in their late twenties living in a new york apartment hotel rather attractive women of independent means with a large estate somewhere in the country both are unmarried and obviously looking for husbands later hammer finds out mdash through first hand experience mdash that mary bellemy is a nymphomaniac esther bellemy whom he never gets to know intimately is no virgin either but much more reserved than her sister mary with whom hammer actually has sex on two separate occasions george kalecki whom hammer knows to have been a crook mdash a bootlegger to be precise mdash but who has obviously achieved a clean record and who now appears to be hal kiness paternal friend paying for the latters tuition and giving him food and lodging in fact it is the other way round hal kines the big shot and the brains of the syndicate has a hold on kalecki hidden away in the vaults of some bank he has documents proving that kalecki is a killer on the loose hal kines who poses as a student of medicine but who is in fact the head of a criminal organisation specializing in prostitution and drug dealing his very sophisticated mdash and complicated mdash way of procuring willing women for his outfit can only be understood if one considers the morally repressed society of the late s again and again he assumes the role of john hanson a student in some provincial college for example in the midwest pretends falling in love with a female student makes her pregnant forces her to have an illegal abortion and then deserts her by now the girls life has been ruined she has been ostracized by both her family and most likely all her friends and acquaintances then a car arrives picks up the desperate young woman and drives her straight to one of the new york call houses operated by his syndicate once there there is no way for her to escape charlotte manning with whom hammer falls in love and who as far as he can see has no motive whatsoever to kill williams hammer the first person narrator of the story describes her as radiating sex in every manner and gesture mary bellemy only had sex charlotte had that plus a lot more charlotte confesses her love for him and he says that he has never been in love before soon they talk about getting married hammer has always admired her golden hair but not before the very end when she strips does he find out that charlotte is a real blonde in the course of the action charlotte manning kills five people after committing her first murder she has to cover up her tracks and murder anyone who might be able to expose her as hammer admits she has an unusual amount of luck helping her to do all that myrna devlin a former dope fiend who as it turns out does not play any important role in the plot at all except that of one of the victims at the bellemys party towards the end of the book myrna alone in an upstairs room where most of the guests have left their coats tries on charlotte mannings coat and discovers heroin in one of its pockets this is the reason why manning has to shoot her too it takes hammer and chambers a long time to figure out what is going on manning continues to kill those who have become dangerous for her at the same time her relationship with hammer deepens we see everything through hammers eyes and for a long time he is completely blind to the facts i hope you get him she said sincerely during a walk through central park while manning is baby sitting for one of her friends she and hammer are shot at the sniper is kalecki but it does not become clear until later that he was after manning he misses on a saturday morning hammer picks up myrna devlin and gives her a lift they drive to the bellemy twins estate in the country for a gigantic all day party there charlotte manning says she has some business to attend to and will be there in time for a tennis game due to take place that evening after an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit by spending all day in his room fast asleep with old junior mdash his gun mdash close to him he is woken up just in time for dinner during which harmon wilder the bellemys lawyer and charles sherman wilders assistant are pointed out to him this is a fine mdash and the final mdash distractor in the novel wilder and sherman are suddenly missing from the party after myrna devlin has been found shot in fact they had illicit drugs on them and did not want to be found out during the tennis game mary bellemy asks

also have a country retreat in the cotswolds quite close to gloucester called horseshoes where they have a large redwood hot tub in their back garden before long helen is invited to join them for a sunday in the country and she gladly accepts to avoid another dreary and empty weekend ralph messengers first passes right from the start ralph messengers philandering is painfully obvious to helen at one of the first social gatherings she attends she happens to see messenger and the wife of the head of the school of english marianne richmond kissing passionately in the kitchen at that point of time she does not know that there is not more to it than meets the eye that they are just playing some sort of secret game one weekend quite early during her stay after they have been in the hot water outside and with carrie already in the house messenger plants a firm kiss on helens lips from the secret journal he is keeping we know that messenger fancies her helen does not actually resist the kiss but afterwards she tells him unmistakably that she is not going to have an affair with him because among other things she strongly disapproves of adultery from helens own journal however we learn that she is sexually aroused by his presence and by just thinking of him messenger who does not know anything about helens real feelings thinks that he has made his pass at her prematurely and by doing so has spoiled any future liaison with her discovery by helen of her husbands cheating meanwhile helen tries to focus on her work the students she has to teach are a small friendly and ambitious group who meet on tuesday and thursday afternoons her class is to a large extent about their work in progress mainly novels which they started during the preceding term when sandra pickering one of the students belatedly submits some chapters from the novel she is writing helen immediately recognizes one of the male characters as having been modelled on her late husband martin as helen herself has based a character in her novel the eye of the storm on martin she is about to accuse sandra pickering of plagiarism when to her dismay she finds out that the girl used to work for the bbc some years ago that she knew martin and that she actually had an affair with him sandra knows and writes about intimate details such as what he preferred doing immediately after sex gradually it dawns upon helen that her husband must have had a whole succession of young lovers with everyone except herself knowing everything or at least suspecting a lot about it while she herself only mildly promiscuous during her student days was never unfaithful to him at this point helen decides to never again shed a tear for him and get on with her own life instead in this new light not even messengers advances seem so monstrous any more discovery of ralphs wifes cheating she makes another discovery which almost turns her view of the world upside down on a free afternoon she escapes the stifling atmosphere of the campus to explore the surrounding countryside seated over lunch in a pub in the small town of ledbury she witnesses mdash a silly coincidence mdash an intimate kiss between carrie messenger and nicholas beck silver haired professor of fine art who is said to be a celibate gay mdash a rumour which he does not do anything about because it serves as the perfect cover up for his affair with carrie messenger whom officially he only helps select fine antiques for the messengers two houses an embarrassing encounter at the pub follows with all three of them keeping up appearances and being polite and reserved later however during a duck race a fund raising event with plastic ducks racing down a small river carrie confides in helen she knows all or almost everything about her husbands flings and by taking a lover herself tries to get back at him ralph messenger she is quite sure does not know anything about her affair also carrie tells her that she screwed around a lot while she was studying at uc berkeley but only with faculty never with other students as spring finally comes and the end of term is rapidly approaching some more unforeseen events happen all of which involve ralph messenger in one way or another troubles never come singly the concretisation of the affair back home in the u s a mr thurlow carries rich father has two serious heart attacks in a row so that carrie books the first flight home she takes hope with her with carrie out of the way for some time mdash in the end it turns out to be three weeks mdash helen who has recently let herself be seduced by messenger spends the most beautiful and romantic mdash or rather lustful mdash three weeks since her husbands death in the language of the kind of novels she loves reading she describes herself as having become a woman of pleasure a scarlet woman a woman of easy virtue she and messenger have sex practically every day and at all kinds of places helen who prefers a bedroom with the curtains drawn is amazed at and eventually fascinated by messengers lust and ingenuity when it comes to selecting odd spots for making love for instance a prehistoric burial mound on top of a hill with some hikers approaching helen also volunteers to perform the duties of a housewife for carrie and then stays over at the messengers house at night she and ralph messenger derive some additional pleasure from trying not to make any sound during their lovemaking so as not to arouse the kids suspicion but emily who has an year old boyfriend and who discusses her sex life with her mother seems to know what is going on anyway and at one point almost blackmails her stepfather soon helen ponders the question whether she is actually falling in love with him and consequently if and how their affair will continue after the end of the term only once when they are in bed together can he not get an erection accumulation of problems for ralph while ralph messenger is busy organizing the international conference on consciousness studies con con to be held at gloucester university this year his recent past catches up with him during a symposium in prague some weeks ago he spent the night with a young scientist called ludmila lisk who now by way of email threatens to expose him as an adulterer if she is not allowed to attend the conference in the end he has to give in to her demand eventually during the conference ludmila lisk clings to messenger in a way that arouses even helens suspicion and jealousy messenger who has recently been suffering from indigestion is diagnosed by his gp as having a lump on his liver which could be cancer immediately he resolves to commit suicide rather than suffer a long and painful process of dying if it is really cancer he has to undergo several tests and endure rather a long period of waiting until he is finally told by a specialist that his problem is harmless and that he is not going to die there is some student protest concerning the universitys affiliation with and funding by the ministry of defence and the honouring of a politician responsible for that funding the police mdash a detective sergeant agnew of the gloucestershire police paedophile and pornography unit inform messenger that child pornography has been downloaded from the internet at some terminal located on campus he is asked by the policeman to volunteer to have his hard disk examined by him and messenger agrees knowing that a his secret journal may be read and all his womanizing come to light and that b you cannot really delete anything from a hard disk once you have stored the information there so there would be no point in delaying the investigation in the end the perpetrator turns out to be professor douglass duggers his deputy head a weird unmarried scientist living together with his mother and sister although the pictures he acquired via the internet turn out to be not very explicit douglass on being confronted by agnew commits suicide by hanging himself in the toilet mdash in a way that seems to have been meticulously planned this happens on the final day of the conference and the term for that matter just as the participants are having their final dinner the end of the affair a final breach of confidence committed by ralph messenger makes it much easier for helen to leave him and go back to london also for the first time it inadvertently triggers some emotion in messenger albeit a negative one jealousy when he is waiting for helen in her maisonette he cannot resist the temptation to turn on her laptop and read parts of her journal this is how he learns about his own wifes infidelity when helen enters her apartment his jealousy gets the better of him so that he cannot hide the fact that he has invaded her privacy originally he suggested that they should exchange their respective journals as each of them would profit from reading the others but helen categorically refused ralph messenger does have to be operated on after all but the surgery is successful however he somewhat ages and in the process loses his reputation as a woman chaser in he publishes a new book entitled machine living and in due course is awarded a cbe he never confronts carrie with her affair and remains married to her helen reed returns to london and resumes writing some time later she meets a new partner but she does not move in with him or he with her in the following year she publishes crying is a puzzler a novel about life on campus quite similar to that of the university of gloucester

the serpent remains completely still concluding that it is dead pinocchio begins to step over it but the serpent suddenly rises up and hisses at the marionette toppling him over onto his head struck

weasels agree and go into the henhouse pinocchio then locks the door and barks loudly the farmer gets the weasels and frees pinocchio as a reward pinocchio comes to where the cottage was and finds

knocks on the door and a snail opens the third story window pinocchio pleads to be let in and the snail says he will come down since a snail is slow it takes all night for the snail to come down and

Dune,Frank Herbert,padishah emperor shaddam iv of house corrino has come to fear house atreides due to the growing popularity of duke leto atreides within the landsraad the convocation of ruling houses shaddam decides that house atreides must be destroyed but cannot risk an overt attack on a single house as this would not be accepted by the landsraad and could be met with civil war the emperor instead uses the centuries old feud between house atreides and house harkonnen to disguise his assault enlisting the brilliant and power hungry baron vladimir harkonnen in his plan to trap and eliminate the atreides to remove them from their fief of caladan where they are protected by their elite navy shaddam entices leto to accept the lucrative fief of the spice planet arrakis previously controlled by the harkonnens letos control of the only planet capable of spice production would increase the power of house atreides which has not historically been influential or wealthy complicating the political intrigue is the fact that the dukes son paul atreides is an essential part of the bene gesserits secret centuries old breeding program letos concubine the bene gesserit lady jessica was ordered to give birth to a daughter capable of determining her childs sex due to her bene gesserit abilities she instead bears a boy to provide an heir for leto leto correctly believes his rivals and enemies to be plotting against him and the atreides are able to thwart initial harkonnen traps and complications while simultaneously building trust with the mysterious desert fremen with whom they hope to ally however the atreides are ultimately unable to withstand a devastating harkonnen attack supported by house corrinos elite corps of sardaukar disguised as harkonnen troops the attack is assisted by a traitor within house atreides suk doctor wellington yueh who is not suspected of disloyalty due to conditioning he underwent to complete his medical training house atreides forces are unable to counterattack effectively and the house is scattered with leto taken captive by yueh and delivered to the harkonnens of the houses principal retainers mentat thufir hawat is captured by the sardaukar the troubador soldier gurney halleck escapes with the aid of smugglers whom he joins and military commander duncan idaho is killed defending paul and jessica yueh who has only betrayed the atreides to further a personal feud with baron harkonnen plants a poison tooth in letos mouth which he hopes will kill the baron when bitten yueh is executed by the baron who distrusts him but leto manages to kill the barons chief retainer mentat piter de vries when he is brought before harkonnen the baron evades the poison cloud expelled from the tooth surviving the attack and enlisting atreides mentat thufir hawat into his service jessicas bene gesserit abilities and pauls developing skills which have been taught to him by his mother help them join a band of fremen paul and his mother quickly learn fremen ways while teaching the fremen the weirding way a bene gesserit method of fighting jessica becomes a reverend mother ingesting the poisonous water of life while pregnant with her second child this unborn daughter alia is subjected to the same ordeal acquiring the full abilities of a reverend mother before even being born paul takes a fremen lover chani with whom he fathers a son years pass and paul increasingly recognizes the strength of the fremen fighting force and their potential to overtake even the unstoppable sardaukar and win back arrakis the spice diet of the fremen and his own developing mental powers cause pauls prescience to be increase dramatically allowing his forsight of future paths of possible events and he is regarded by the fremen as their prophesied messiah as paul grows in influence he begins a jihad against harkonnen rule of the planet under his new fremen name muaddib however paul becomes aware through his prescience that if he is not careful the fremen will extend that jihad against all the known universe which paul describes as a humanity spanning subconscious effort to avoid genetic stagnation both the emperor and the baron harkonnen show increasing concern at the fervor of religious fanaticism shown on arrakis for this muaddib not guessing that this leader is the presumed dead paul harkonnen plots to send his nephew and heir feyd rautha as a replacement for his more brutish nephew glossu rabban who is in charge of the planet with the hope of gaining the respect of the population however the emperor is highly suspicious of the baron and sends spies to watch his movements hawat explains the emperors suspicions the sardaukar nearly invincible in battle are trained on the prison planet salusa secundus whose inhospitable conditions allow only the best to survive arrakis serves as a similar crucible and the emperor fears that the baron could recruit from it a fighting force to rival his sardaukar just as house atreides had intended before its destruction paul is reunited with gurney completely loyal to the atreides gurney is convinced that jessica is the traitor who caused the houses downfall and nearly kills her before being stopped by paul disturbed that his prescience had not predicted this possibility paul decides to take the water of life an act which will either confirm his status as the kwisatz haderach or kill him after three weeks in a near death state paul emerges with his powers refined and focused he is able to see past present and future at will looking into space he sees that the emperor and the harkonnens have amassed a huge armada to invade the planet and regain control paul also realizes the way to control spice production on arrakis saturating spice fields with the water of life would cause a chain reaction that would destroy all spice on the planet in an imperial attack on a fremen settlement paul and chanis son leto is killed and the four year old alia is captured by sardaukar and brought to the planets capital arrakeen where the baron harkonnen is attempting to thwart the fremen jihad under the close watch of the emperor the emperor is surprised at alias defiance of his power and her confidence in her brother whom she reveals to be paul atreides at that moment under cover of a gigantic sandstorm paul and his army of fremen attack the city riding sandworms alia kills the baron during the confusion paul quickly overtakes the citys defenses and confronts the emperor threatening to destroy the spice thereby ending space travel and crippling both imperial power and the bene gesserit in one blow feyd rautha challenges paul to a knife duel in a final attempt to stop his overthrow but is defeated despite an attempt at treachery realizing that paul is capable of doing all he has threatened the emperor is forced to abdicate and to promise his daughter princess irulan in marriage to paul chani is not happy with this decision and paul describes that chani will always be the one he loves paul ascends the throne his control of arrakis and the spice establishing a new kind of power over the empire that will change the face of the

The Beach,Alex Garland,in a cheap hostel on khao san road in bangkok richard a young english traveller meets a strange scotsman going by the pseudonym of daffy duck who leaves him a hand drawn map of a supposed hidden beach located in the gulf of thailand that is inaccessible to tourists after receiving the map richard discovers that daffy has committed suicide together with a young and beautiful french couple tienne and fran oise the trio sets out to find what they believe must be paradise on earth on their way to the beach richard gives a copy of the map to sammy and zeph two american harvard students he meets in koh samui when the three travellers finally reach the beach after bribing a local boat contractor taking a long swim trekking the dense jungle stumbling across a marijuana plantation and avoiding its heavily armed guards and eventually jumping down a waterfall they are faced with a tight knit and largely self sufficient community which has almost completely shut itself off from civilization and which has developed a sophisticated hierarchy under the quasi dictatorial rule of a young american woman called sal and her south african lover bugs who along with daffy discovered the beach and founded the community there in the three went under the pseudonyms of sylvester modified as salvester and hence sal bugs bugs bunny and daffy daffy duck when richard tienne and fran oise arrive it is already six years after the founders discovered the beach only a select few are chosen by the original founders to come to the island and thus newcomers who were not given a personal invitation are not welcome but are not sent away because to do so would jeopardize the secrecy of the community richard tienne and fran oise manage to incorporate themselves into the island community and are quickly accepted because they tell the community about daffy and his death back on the thai mainland because the community is largely self sufficient in terms of food production supply and infrastructure work is very important and there are a number of details or work rosters for the garden fishing cooking and carpentry along with fran oise and etienne richard becomes a part of the fishing detail after a few months life becomes very idyllic on the island with richard making friends with a few other members of the beach community keaty a fellow englishman hooked on his game boy gregorio a spanish traveller part of his fishing detail unhygienix the italian head chef with an intense obsession for bath soap jesse and cassie two lovers who work in the gardening and carpentry detail respectively ella who works second in command with unhygenix in the cooking detail and finally jed the enigmatic loner of the group whose sole separate detail is shrouded in mystery richard later discovers that jed has been assigned by sal as the islands guardian to keep a lookout on the islands perimeter and scope out arriving travellers who had heard word about the beach with a sideline of stealing some marijuana from the other side of the island protected by heavily armed thai farmers in time unhygenix informs everyone that their rice supply has been infected by a fungus and sal announces an emergency rice run a regular chore wherein a few community members are required to head to the mainland discreetly by boat to buy some rice and additional supplies if need be because of this daunting task hardly anyone volunteers for this job except for jed who to the bewilderment of most in the island always volunteers for the job richard also volunteers and so the two travel back to koh phangan for their supplies it is during the rice run that jed finds out that richard gave a copy of the map to sammy and zeph when jed overheard the two americans talking about the beach to some german travellers the rice run goes without a hitch but soon zeph and sammy are accompanied by the three germans they met on the mainland and they arrive at the neighbouring island which worries richard because he might be blamed if they successfully arrive on the beach coinciding with this troubling development sal reassigns richard to the perimeter detail to partner with jed and keep a close eye on the impending invaders because of a free spot in gregorios fishing detail keaty moves in to take richards place a few days later keaty catches a dead squid that poisons most of the residents and the few healthy members remaining struggle to nurse the sick residents back to normalcy after the food poisoning incident richard returns from his sentry duty high on the island to find that bugs has punched keaty in the face because of the squid disaster richard having never liked bugs due to his stoic nature instigates a heated argument with him and the community becomes fractured into several social groups on this day only two of the fishing details are still in operation and the best detail consisting of three swedes christo sten and karl who fish outside the safe lagoon area is attacked by a shark the camp only finds out about this with the return of one of the three karl in the early evening karl carries sten on his back to the island where sten is discovered to be already dead on arrival karl was not physically hurt by the shark but he suffers a mental breakdown from the traumatic event karl subsequently spends his time sitting in a dug out hole on the beach and not talking to anyone barely accepting food and water richard realises that christo is still missing and at his own risk goes to find him in the partially submerged caves of the lagoon richard is praised for his heroic rescue of christo however as christo is gravely wounded he requires jeds presence in the camp because he has some medical knowledge to tend to him this leaves richard to work the sentry detail alone on the island a few days later a funeral is held for sten near the jungle waterfall and sal gives a decisive speech which goes some way to restoring social harmony within the camp she announces that it is the th of september and that they will thus be celebrating the tet festival in days time this will be the sixth birthday for the beach community and she suggests they celebrate it as a fresh start for the group being alone on the mainland of the island since his transfer to jeds detail richard now begins to have hallucinations in which daffy appears they talk regularly and begin to patrol the part of the island which richard refers to as the dmz together richard comes to appreciate that daffy killed himself because he could neither endure the slow unravelling of his elitist vision of the beach as the community grew nor a return to normal life and that he himself is falling prey to that way of thinking richard also realizes that daffy gave him the map so other travellers would find the beach daffy describes this act as euthanizing the secluded beach community and richard realizes he was merely a pawn in daffys scheme this comes to a peak following the arrival of the american german group by raft unlike richard tienne and fran oise who managed to overcome the five main obstacles in getting to the beach the newcomers never make it past the fourth hurdle the marijuana field guarded by the thai farmers richard witnesses them being first beaten and then taken away afraid to see any further richard runs away but hears the ominous sound of fired gunshots signifying that the thai farmers have killed the intruders richard returns to the community campsite to immediately inform sal and jed he then goes to the beach to visit karl who after being provoked seemingly attacks richard and runs off into the jungle the next day the day of the tet festival sal obtusely asks richard to kill karl because of the threat he poses to the mood of the celebrations with her constant excuse of having to lift the morale of the community richard disillusioned of the beachs way of living finally resolves to escape with his closest friends that night he swims out to the cave where the groups only boat is kept only to find that karl has used it to escape to the mainland tienne corners him thereafter and soon discovers that he along with the rest of his clique has become afraid of richard doing things for sal richard convinces tienne fran oise jed and a now paranoid keaty to leave the beach for good after having euthanized the dying christo night falls and the tet festival is going in full swing prior to the party keaty and richard spiked the stew unhygenix cooked with marijuana sending the partygoers on an overloaded high along with some fermented coconut juice which severely inebriates most of the group richard and his friends are almost in the clear to escape when suddenly the marijuana guards arrive at the camp to threaten all of them and beat up richard leaving the dead bodies of the american german party as a warning most of the beach dwellers begin to go insane and suddenly start to rip the bodies apart in a terrifying frenzy sal discovers that richard has spread the secret of the beach when she picks up the map he drew for zeph and sammy brought by the head thai guard upon this information the unstable community members work themselves into a murderous rage stabbing richard multiple times and bringing him close to death he is saved when fran oise tienne keaty and jed return from the beach with fishing spears to drive the others off wounding sal and bugs in the process richard and his rescuers make an escape with the raft that the now dead intruders left on the other side of the island in the epilogue it is revealed that the five friends managed to get away and used their travelling street savvy to return to civilization it has been a year and one month since their departure from thailand and richard has returned to his home in the united kingdom where he has not heard from fran oise and tienne again but knows he is likely to bump into them eventually because the world is a small place and europe is even smaller however he still keeps in contact with keaty and jed richard comments unexpectedly they are able to deal with their shared history by chance keaty and jed end up working in the same building although for different companies coincidentally like how they both stayed in the same guest house that burned down a few years before they both arrived at the beach he also hears of a news report on how cassie has been arrested in malaysia for smuggling a large amount of heroin and is the first westerner to be executed in the country in six years richard wonders whether other people got off the island too especially unhygienix who was a decent guy he believes that bugs died and hopes that sal died too although not maliciously he states that he does not like the idea of her turning up on his doorstep richard finishes by saying he is content with his life though he carries a lot of scars i like the way that sounds i carry a lot of scars

the muses of greek mythology whom fry had captured earlier in his life in exchange for a bezoar fry kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels madoc also takes her captive and has great success in writing but calliope calls upon the triad of witches known by many names such as the furies the kindly ones or the gracious ladies for help they direct her to morpheus who we are told was once her lover this relationship is elaborated on later in the series and who is currently similarly imprisoned upon his release he

though the story of calliope was not criticized for unoriginality at the time of its release its concept has apparently become a very popular one since a list of overused story ideas at strange horizons included creative person meets a muse either one of the nine classical muses or a more individual muse and interacts with them usually by keeping them captive see neil gaimans post about strange horizons list madocs book her wings appears in a few other stories by neil gaiman including the last temptation as a sort of inside joke rose walker is later seen reading frys book here comes a candle in the library of dream an unfinished book by erasmus fry the hand of glory is seen in season of mists one of madocs works the spirit who had half of everything takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of james branch cabells figures of earth this tale begins with a small white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night they speak of an event in a graveyard that they dont want to miss when they arrive they see that many cats are already there a siamese cat comes to tell her story a long time ago the siamese cat relates she met a tom cat who became her lover eventually she gave birth to several kittens her human owners were not pleased and the male owner put the kittens in a bag bound to a rock and threw them into pond traumatized by the callous murder of her kittens the siamese becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the dreaming in the dream a raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring a cave inhabited by the dream lord at the entrance to the cave that the raven told her of many fearsome animals tell her to leave she responds by saying that she will only state her business to dream inside she finds dream in the form of a cat dream presents her with a vision of an alternate reality where cats are huge and humans are merely their playthings tiny servants which groom their bodies and which the cats can kill at their leisure a man ruined that world by informing the humans that their dreams will shape the world enough humans listened to make the vision a reality upon waking the cat undertakes a spiritual quest for justice she preaches her vision to motley assortments of housecats around the world hoping that if she can make enough believe in and dream of this reality the world will change to conform to their dreams the cat from the beginning of the story heads home her friends were slightly disappointed though they admitted that what they heard was interesting the white cat however was fully taken by the tale she returns home and heads to sleep over breakfast her owners remark on what a cute stance shes in it looks as if shes hunting something or someone although seemingly a complete diversion from the basic story of the sandman it in fact illustrates some of the core themes of the series the idea that reality is shaped in the most literal sense by the dreams beliefs and expectations of humans and in this case of other animals as well the story also portrays the theme of change and its relation to an individuals nature the humans found that they were unhappy with their role and were able to harness the power of dream to instigate a change of the nature of reality whereas when cats found themselves in a similar situation their apathetic independent and fickle nature kept them from changing this idea of the capacity for change reemerges throughout the book most notably in the conclusion of the kindly ones this section is linked from characters of the sandman this is a core issue of the sandman series sometimes cited as the best in the series it concerns the premiere of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream which we are told was commissioned by morpheus as part of a bargain in which morpheus granted shakespeare his extraordinary skill with writing performed on a hillside before an audience of bizarre creatures from faerie including the very characters who appear in the play titania auberon and the hobgoblin robin goodfellow puck amongst them the sandmans version of reality and shakespeares play are merged and interact with one another puck greatly enjoys the play and repeats the theme of the story that while the play does not directly reflect history or even some of the personalities of the characters it is still considered a true reflection of reality in reality puck is described as being a psychotic murderer and not a merry wanderer of the night titania takes an interest in shakespeares son hamnet who plays a small role in the play the issue received a world fantasy award for short fiction in dream first meets shakespeare in sandman men of good fortune and the final issue the tempest focuses on the second of the two plays commissioned by morpheus this is another odd issue featuring one of the methods gaiman played with in the first and to a lesser extent in the second collection it takes one of the neglected characters from the dc universe this time element girl urania blackwell a female version of metamorpho and shows her in a completely unexpected situation a reluctant superhero at best she has now retired and lives a meagre existence rarely leaving her flat due to her self loathing of her freakish appearance she goes by her nickname rainie the plot revolves around a phone call she receives an invitation to have dinner with an old friend della she concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn t know of her skin disease as della explains a problem she s having rainie s face falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered revealing her true face she runs away and to her apartment where she wonders how she can kill herself despite being invulnerable fortunately death who was dealing with a woman who d slipped on a stepladder enters her room explaining that the door was open and she had heard her crying she tells her how she can talk to the sun god ra and beg for a merciful death an extraordinarily poignant piece dealing with identity and subtly the gap between the world portrayed in the more na ve of dc comics superhero comics and the true reality of everyday life it ends on a curiously happy note with death answering rainie s telephone and informing the caller that she s gone away i m afraid

Finnegans Wake,James Joyce,finnegans wake comprises chapters divided into four books book i contains chapters books ii and iii contain and book iv consists of only one short chapter the chapters appear without titles and while joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had done for ulysses he did title various sections published separately see publication history below the standard critical practice however is to indicate book number in roman numerals and chapter title in arabic so that iii for example indicates the second chapter of the third book given the books fluid and changeable approach to plot and characters a definitive critically agreed upon plot synopsis remains elusive see critical response and themes difficulties of plot summary below therefore the following synopsis attempts to summarise events in the book which find general although inevitably not universal consensus among critics the entire work is cyclical in nature the last sentence a fragment recirculates to the beginning sentence a way a lone a last a loved a long the riverrun past eve and adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to howth castle and environs joyce himself revealed that the book ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence the introductory chapter i establishes the books setting as howth castle and environs and introduces dublin hod carrier finnegan who falls to his death from a ladder while constructing a wall finnegans wife annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake but he vanishes before they can eat him mutt and jute and the prankquean at the chapters close a fight breaks out whiskey splashes on finnegans corpse and the dead finnegan rises from his coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners put him back to rest persuading him that he is better off where he is the chapter ends with the image of the hce character sailing into dublin bay to take a central role in the story i opens with an account of harold or humphrey chimpden receiving the nickname earwicker from the sailor king who encounters him attempting to catch earwigs with an inverted flowerpot on a stick while manning a tollgate through which the king is passing this name helps chimpden now known by his initials hce to rise to prominence in dublin society as here comes everybody he is then brought low by a rumor that begins to spread across dublin apparently concerning a sexual trespass involving two girls in the phoenix park although details of hces transgression change with each retelling of events chapters i through i follow the progress of this rumor starting with hces encounter with a cad with a pipe in phoenix park the cad greets hce in gaelic and asks the time but hce misunderstands the question as an accusation and incriminates himself by denying rumours the cad has not yet heard these rumours quickly spread across dublin gathering momentum until they are turned into a song penned by the character hosty called the ballad of persse oreilly as a result hce goes into hiding where he is besieged at the closed gate of his pub by a visiting american looking for drink after hours however hce remains silent not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse dreams is buried in a coffin at the bottom of lough neagh and is finally brought to trial under the name festy king he is eventually freed and goes once more into hiding an important piece of evidence during the trial a letter about hce written by his wife alp is called for so that it can be examined in closer detail alps letter becomes the focal point as it is analysed in detail in i this letter was dictated by alp to her son shem a writer and entrusted to her other son shaun a postman for delivery the letter never reaches its intended destination ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named biddy chapter i digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail in the form of twelve riddles and answers in the final two chapters of book i we learn more about the letters writer shem the penman i and its original author his mother alp i the shem chapter consists of shauns character assassination of his brother shem describing the hermetic artist as a forger and a sham before shem is protected by his mother alp who appears at the end to come and defend her son the following chapter concerning shems mother known as anna livia plurabelle is interwoven with thousands of river names from all over the globe and is widely considered the books most celebrated passage the chapter was described by joyce in as a chattering dialogue across the river by two washerwomen who as night falls become a tree and a stone these two washerwomen gossip about alps response to the allegations laid against her husband hce as they wash clothes in the liffey alp is said to have written a letter declaring herself tired of her mate their gossip then digresses to her youthful affairs and sexual encounters before returning to the publication of hces guilt in the morning newspaper and his wifes revenge on his enemies borrowing a mailsack from her son shaun the post she delivers presents to her children at the chapters close the washerwomen try to pick up the thread of the story but their conversation is increasingly difficult as they are on opposite sides of the widening liffey and it is getting dark finally as they turn into a tree and a stone they ask to be told a tale of shem or shaun while book i of finnegans wake deals mostly with the parents hce and alp book ii shifts that focus onto their children shem shaun and issy ii opens with a pantomime programme which outlines in relatively clear language the identities and attributes of the books main characters the chapter then concerns a guessing game among the children in which shem is challenged three times to guess by gazework the colour which the girls have chosen unable to answer due to his poor eyesight shem goes into exile in disgrace and shaun wins the affection of the girls finally hce emerges from the pub and in a thunder like voice calls the children inside chapter ii follows shem shaun and issy studying upstairs in the pub after having been called inside in the previous chapter the chapter depicts shem coaching shaun how to do euclid bk i structured as a reproduction of a schoolboys and schoolgirls old classbook complete with marginalia by the twins who change sides at half time and footnotes by the girl who doesnt once shem here called dolph has helped shaun here called kev to draw the euclid diagram the latter realises that he has drawn a diagram of alps genitalia and kev finally realises the significance of the

apparently united in a desire to overcome their parents ii moves to hce working in the pub below the studying children as hce serves his customers two narratives are broadcast via the bars radio and television sets namely the norwegian captain and the tailors daughter and how buckley shot the russian general the first portrays hce as a norwegian captain succumbing to domestication through his marriage to the tailors daughter the latter told by shem and shaun ciphers butt and taff casts hce as a russian general who is shot by the soldier buckley earwicker has been absent throughout the latter tale having been summoned upstairs by alp he returns and is reviled by his customers who see buckleys shooting of the general as symbolic of shem and shauns supplanting their father this condemnation of his character forces hce to deliver a general confession of his crimes including an incestuous desire for young girls finally a policeman arrives to send the drunken customers home the pub is closed up and the customers disappear singing into the night as a drunken hce clearing up the bar and swallowing the dregs of the glasses left behind morphs into ancient irish high king rory oconnor and passes out ii ostensibly portraying the drunken and sleeping earwickers dream chronicles the spying of four old men matthew mark luke and john on tristan and iseults journey the short chapter portrays an old man like king mark being rejected and abandoned by young lovers who sail off into a future without him while the four old men observe tristan and isolde and offer four intertwining commentaries on the lovers and themselves which are always repeating themselves book iii concerns itself almost exclusively with shaun in his role as postman having to deliver alps letter which was referred to in book but never seen iii opens with the four masters ass narrating how he thought as he was dropping asleep he had heard and seen an apparition of shaun the post as a result shaun re awakens and floating down the liffey in a barrel is posed questions concerning the significance and content of the letter he is carrying however shaun apprehensive about being slighted is on his guard and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him shauns answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letters author his artist brother shem after the inquisition shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrators earshot before disappearing completely from view in iii shaun re appears as jaunty jaun and delivers a lengthy sermon to his sister issy and her schoolmates from st brigids school throughout this book shaun is continually regressing changing from an old man to an overgrown baby lying on his back and eventually in iii into a vessel through which the voice of hce speaks again by means of a spiritual medium this leads to hces defence of his life in

tries to wake her sleeping husband declaring rise up man of the hooths you have slept so long and remembers a walk they once took and hopes for its re occurrence at the close of her monologue alp as

The Razor's Edge,W. Somerset Maugham,maugham begins by characterising his story as not really a novel but a thinly veiled true account he includes himself as a minor character a writer who drifts in and out of the lives of the major players larry darrell s lifestyle is contrasted throughout the book with that of his fianc e s uncle elliott templeton an american expatriate living in paris and a shallow and unrepentant yet generous snob for example while templetons roman catholicism embraces the hierarchical trappings of the church larrys proclivities tend towards the th century flemish mystic and saint john of ruysbroeck wounded and traumatized by the death of a comrade in the war larry returns to chicago illinois and his fianc e isabel bradley only to announce that he does not plan to work and instead will loaf on his small inheritance he wants to delay their marriage and refuses to take up a job as a stockbroker offered to him by henry maturin the father of his friend gray meanwhile larry s childhood friend sophie settles into a happy marriage only later tragically losing her husband and baby in a car accident larry moves to paris and immerses himself in study and bohemian life after two years of this loafing isabel visits and larry asks her to join his life of wandering and searching living in paris and traveling with little money she cannot accept his vision of life and breaks their engagement to go back to chicago there she marries the millionaire gray who provides her a rich family life meanwhile larry begins a sojourn through europe taking a job at a coal mine in lens france where he befriends a former polish army officer named kosti kostis influence encourages larry to look toward things spiritual for his answers rather than in books larry and kosti leave the coal mine and travel together for a time before parting ways larry then meets a benedictine monk named father ensheim in bonn germany while father ensheim is on leave from his monastery doing academic research after spending several months with the benedictines and being unable to reconcile their conception of god with his own larry takes a job on an ocean liner and finds himself in bombay larry has significant spiritual adventures in india and comes back to paris what he actually found in india and what he finally concluded are held back from the reader for a considerable time until in a scene late in the book maugham discusses india and spirituality with larry in a caf long into the evening he starts off the chapter by saying i feel it right to warn the reader that he can very well skip this chapter without losing the thread of the story as i have to tell since for most part it is nothing more than the account of a conversation that i had with larry however i should add that except for this conversation i would perhaps not have thought it worthwhile to write this book maugham then initiates the reader to advaita philosophy and reveals how through deep meditation larry goes on to realize god and thus become a saint in the process gaining liberation from the cycle of human suffering birth and death that the rest of the earthly mortals are subject to the stock market crash has ruined gray and he and isabel are invited to live in her uncle elliott templeton s grand parisian house gray is often incapacitated with agonizing migraines due to a general nervous collapse larry is able to help him using an indian form of hypnotic suggestion sophie has also drifted to the french capital where her friends find her reduced to alcohol opium and promiscuity empty and dangerous

The Languages of Pao,Jack Vance,the planet pao is a quiet backwater with a large homogeneous stolid population ruled by an absolute monarch the panarch the current panarch attempts to hire an offworld scientist lord palafox from the breakness institute on the planet breakness as a consultant in order to reform pao before the deal can be concluded however the panarch is assassinated by his brother bustamonte using mind control over the panarchs own son beran panasper to do so lord palafox saves beran panasper and takes him to breakness as a possible bargaining chip in his dealings with pao somewhat later the predatory brumbo clan from the planet batmarsh raids the virtually defenseless pao with impunity and the panarch bustamonte is forced to pay heavy tribute to rid himself of the brumbos he seeks the aid of palafox who has a plan to create warrior technical and mercantile castes on pao using customized languages named valiant technicant and cogitant and other means to shape the mindsets of each caste isolating them from each other and the general populace of pao to achieve this each caste gets a special training area where it is completely segregated from any outside influence the necessary land is confiscated from families some of which have held it for countless generations nbsp which creates some disaffection in the conservative paonese population and earns bustamonte the name of a tyrant in order to return with them to pao incognito beran panasper infiltrates a corps of interpreters being trained on breakness mostly to amuse themselves some of the young people create a language they call pastiche mixing words and grammatical forms seemingly at random from the three newly created languages and from the original paonese language palafox looks upon this development with indulgence failing to realize the tremendous long term significance beran returns to pao under the name ercolo paraio and works for a few years as a translator at several locations once beran panasper reveals to the masses that he is still alive his uncle bustamontes popular support melts virtually overnight and panasper claims the title of panarch that is rightfully his the brumbo clan is repulsed by the warrior caste for a few years the castes of pao are highly successful in their respective endeavors and the planet experiences a short golden age however panasper is upset about the divisions in the populace of pao caused by the palafox program the three new castes speak of the rest of the paonese as they rather than we and regard them with contempt beran attempts to return the planet to its previous state by re integrating the castes into the general populace palafox opposes this move and is killed but the warrior caste stages a coup and takes command of pao panasper convinces them that they cannot rule the planet alone since they share no common language with the rest of the population and can not rely on the cooperation of the other segments of the people of pao and they allow him to keep his office one interpretation of the end of the novel is that beran panasper is only in nominal charge of the planet on the sufferance of the warrior caste and that it is uncertain what will become of him and his plans of re uniting the populace of pao another way of seeing the ending is that beran has outfoxed the warriors by getting them to agree to his decree that every child of pao of whatever caste must learn pastiche even in preference to the language of his father in the end beran looks ahead twenty years to a future when all inhabitants of pao will be pastiche speakers nbsp i e will speak a language which mixes some attributes and mindsets appropriate to peasant cultivators proud warriors skilled technicians and smart merchants nbsp which will presumably shape a highly fluid and socially mobile society composed of versatile and multi skilled individuals

Cat's Cradle,Kurt Vonnegut,at the opening of the book the narrator an everyman named john a k a jonah describes a time when he was planning to write a book about what important americans did on the day hiroshima was bombed while researching this topic john becomes involved with the children of felix hoenikker a nobel laureate physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb john travels to ilium new york to interview the hoenikker children and others for his book in ilium john meets among others dr asa breed who was the supervisor on paper of felix hoenikker as the novel progresses john learns of a substance called ice nine created by the late hoenikker and now secretly in the possession of his children ice nine is an alternative structure of water that is solid at room temperature when a crystal of ice nine contacts liquid water it becomes a seed crystal that makes the molecules of liquid water arrange themselves into the solid form ice nine john and the hoenikker children eventually end up on the fictional caribbean island of san lorenzo one of the poorest countries on earth where the people speak a barely comprehensible creole of english for example twinkle twinkle little star is rendered tsvent kiul tsvent kiul lett pool store it is ruled by the dictator papa monzano who threatens all opposition with impalement on a giant hook san lorenzo has an unusual culture and history which john learns about while studying a guidebook lent to him by the newly appointed us ambassador to the country he learns about an influential religious movement in san lorenzo called bokononism a strange postmodern faith that combines irreverent nihilistic and cynical observations about life and gods will with odd but peaceful rituals for instance the supreme act of worship is an intimate act consisting of prolonged physical contact between the bare soles of the feet of two persons supposed to result in peace and joy between the two communicants though everyone on the island seems to know much about bokononism and its founder bokonon the present government calls itself christian and those caught practising bokononism are punished with death by the giant hook as the story progresses it becomes clear that san lorenzon society is more bizarre and cryptic than originally revealed in observing the interconnected lives of some of the islands most influential residents john learns that bokonon himself was at one point a de facto ruler of the island along with a us marine deserter the two men created bokononism as part of a utopian project to control the population the ban was an attempt to give the religion a sense of forbidden glamour and it is found that almost all of the residents of san lorenzo including the dictator practice the faith and executions are rare when john and the other travelers arrive on the island they are greeted by president papa monzano and around five thousand san lorenzans it becomes clear that papa monzano is extremely ill and he intends to name franklin hoenikker his successor franklin uncomfortable with this arrangement abruptly hands the presidency to john who grudgingly accepts the dictator later uses ice nine to commit suicide rather than succumb to his inoperable cancer consistent with the properties of ice nine the dictators corpse instantly turns into solid ice at room temperature during johns inauguration festivities in which the american ambassador to san lorenzo was going to speak san lorenzos small air force was supposed to present a brief air show one of the airplanes crashes into the dictators seaside palace and causes his still frozen body to tumble into the ocean and all the water in the worlds seas rivers and groundwater turns into ice nine killing almost all life in a few days john manages to escape with his wife a native san lorenzan named mona they later discover a mass grave where all the surviving san lorenzans had killed themselves with ice nine on the facetious advice of bokonon displaying a mix of grief and resigned amusement mona kills herself as well john takes refuge with a few other survivors an american couple he had met on the plane to san lorenzo and felix hoenikkers two sons and lives in a cave for several months during which time he writes a memoir revealed to be the novel itself the book ends by his meeting a weary bokonon who is contemplating what the last words of the books of bokonon should be bokonon states that if he were younger he would have climbed to the top of mt mccabe and placed a book about human stupidity at the top the republic of san lorenzo is a fictional country where much of the books second half takes place san lorenzo is a tiny rocky island nation located in the caribbean sea positioned in the relative vicinity of puerto rico san lorenzo has only one city its seaside capital of bolivar the countrys form of government is a dictatorship under the rule of ailing president papa monzano who is a staunch ally of the united states and a fierce opponent of communism no legislature exists the infrastructure of san lorenzo is described as being dilapidated consisting of worn buildings dirt roads an impoverished populace and having only one automobile taxi running in the entire country the language of san lorenzo is a fictitious english based creole language that is referred to as the san lorenzan dialect the san lorenzan national anthem is based on the tune of home on the range its flag consists of a u s marine corps corporals stripes on a blue field presumably the flag was updated since in the s marine corps rank insignia did not include crossed rifles its currency is named corporals at a rate of two corporals for every united states dollar both the flag and the monetary unit are named after u s marine corporal earl mccabe who deserted his company while stationed at port au prince during the american occupation in and in transit to miami was shipwrecked on san lorenzo mccabe along with accomplice lionel boyd johnson from tobago would together throw out the islands governing sugar company and after a period of anarchy proclaimed a republic san lorenzo also has its own native religion bokononism a religion based on enjoying life through its untruths bokononism founded by mccabes accomplice boyd johnson pronounced bokonon in san lorenzan dialect however is outlawed an idea bokonon himself conceived for the purpose of spreading the religion and making the residents of the island happier bokononists are liable to be punished by being impaled on a hook but bokononism privately remains the dominant religion of nearly everyone on the island including the leaders who outlaw it officially san lorenzo is a christian nation however both catholicism and protestantism are illegal this leads to a rather haphazard issuing of last rites

wearing it carrying scudders pocket book he catches an anglo scottish express train leaving from london st pancras station hannay fixes upon galloway in south west scotland as a suitably remote place in which to make his escape and remembers somehow the town of newton stewart which he names as his destination when he buys his ticket from the guard arriving at a remote station somewhere in galloway apparently not newton stewart itself hannay lodges in a shepherds cottage the next morning he reads in a newspaper that the police are looking for him in scotland reasoning that the police would expect him to head for a port on the west coast he doubles back and boards a local train heading east but jumps off between stations he is seen but escapes finding an inn where he stays the night he tells the innkeeper a modified version of his story and the man is persuaded to shelter him while staying at the inn hannay cracks the substitution cipher used in scudders pocket book the next day two men arrive at the inn looking for hannay but the innkeeper sends them away when they return later hannay steals their car and escapes on his way hannay reflects on what he has learnt from scudders notes they contradict the story that scudder first told to him and mention an enemy group called the black stone and the mysterious thirty nine steps the united kingdom appears to be in danger of an invasion by germany and its allies by this time hannay is being pursued by an aeroplane and a policeman in a remote village has tried to stop him trying to avoid an oncoming car hannay crashes his own but the other driver offers to take him home the man is sir harry a local landowner and prospective politician although politically very naive when he learns of hannays experience of south africa he invites him to address an election meeting that afternoon hannays speech impresses sir harry and hannay feels able to trust him with his story sir harry writes an introductory letter about hannay to a relation in the foreign office hannay leaves sir harry and tries to hide in the countryside but is spotted by the aeroplane soon he spots a group of men on the ground searching for him miraculously he meets a road mender out on the moor and swaps places with him sending the workman home his disguise fools his pursuers who pass him by on the same road he meets a rich motorist whom he recognises from london and whom he forces to exchange clothes with him and drive him off the moor the next day hannay manages to stay ahead of the pursuers and hides in a cottage occupied by an elderly man unfortunately the man turns out to be one of the enemy and with his accomplices he imprisons hannay fortunately the room in which hannay is locked is full of bomb making materials which he uses to break out of the cottage injuring himself in the process a day later hannay retrieves his possessions from the helpful roadmender and stays for a few days to recover from the explosion he dines at a public house in moffat before walking to the junction at beattock to catch a southbound train to england changing at crewe birmingham new street and reading to meet sir harrys relative at the foreign office sir walter bullivant at his country home in berkshire as they discuss scudders notes sir walter receives a phone call to tell him that karolides has been assassinated sir walter now at his house in london lets hannay in on some military secrets before releasing him to go home hannay is unable to shake off his sense of involvement in important events and returns to sir walters house where a high level meeting is in progress he is just in time to see a man whom he recognises as one of his former pursuers in scotland leaving the house hannay warns sir walter that the man ostensibly the first sea lord is about to return to europe with the information he has obtained from their meeting at that point hannay realises that the phrase the thirty nine steps could refer to the landing point in england from which the spy is about to set sail throughout the night hannay and the united kingdoms military leaders try to work out the meaning of the mysterious phrase after some reasoning worthy of sherlock holmes and with the help of a knowledgeable coastguard the group decide on a coastal town in kent they find a path down from the cliff that has thirty nine steps just offshore they see a yacht posing as fishermen some of the party visit the yacht the ariadne and find that at least one of the crew appears to be german the only people onshore are playing tennis by a villa and appear to be english but they match scudders description of the conspirators the black stone hannay alone confronts the men at the villa after a struggle two of the men are captured while the third flees to the yacht which meanwhile has been seized by the british authorities the plot is thwarted and the united kingdom enters the first world war having kept its military secrets from the enemy on the outbreak of war hannay joins the army with a captains rank

Nibelungenlied,,though the preface to the poem promises both joyous and dark tales ahead the nibelungenlied is by and large a very tragic work and these four opening verses are believed to have been a late addition to the text composed after the body of the poem had been completed class toccolours cellpadding rules cols middle high german original shumway translation uns ist in alten m ren wunders

old of heroes worthy of praise of hardships dire of joy and feasting of weeping and of wailing of the fighting of bold warriors now ye may hear wonders told the original version instead began with the introduction of kriemhild the protagonist of the work the epic is divided into two parts the first dealing with the story of siegfried and kriemhild the wooing of br nhild and the death of siegfried at the hands of hagen and hagens hiding of the nibelung treasure in the rhine chapters the second part deals with kriemhilds marriage to etzel her plans for revenge the journey of the burgundians to the court of etzel and their last stand in etzels hall chapters the first chapter introduces the court of burgundy kriemhild the virgin sister of king gunther and his brothers gernot and giselher has a dream of a falcon that is killed by two eagles her mother interprets this to mean that kriemhilds future husband will die a violent death and kriemhild consequently resolves to remain unmarried the second chapter tells of the background of siegfried crown prince of xanten his youth is narrated with little room for the adventures later attributed to him in the third chapter siegfried arrives in worms with the hopes of wooing kriemhild upon his arrival hagen von tronje one of king gunthers vassals tells gunther about siegfrieds youthful exploits that involved winning a treasure and lands from a pair of brothers nibelung and schilbung whom siegfried had killed when he was unable to divide the treasure between them and almost incidentally the killing of a dragon siegfried leaves his treasure in the charge of a dwarf named alberich after killing the dragon siegfried then bathed in its blood which rendered him invulnerable unfortunately for siegfried a leaf fell onto his back from a linden tree and the small patch of skin that the leaf covered did not come into contact with the dragons blood leaving siegfried vulnerable in that single spot in spite of hagens threatening stories about his youth the burgundians welcome him but do not allow him to meet the princess disappointed he nonetheless remains in worms and helps gunther defeat the invading saxons in chapter siegfried finally meets kriemhild gunther requests siegfried to sail with him to the fictional city of isenstein in iceland to win the hand of icelands queen br nhild siegfried agrees though only if gunther allows him to marry gunthers sister kriemhild whom siegfried pines for gunther siegfried and a group of burgundians set sail for iceland with siegfried pretending to be gunthers vassal upon their arrival br nhild challenges gunther to a trial of strength with her hand in marriage as a reward if they lose however they will be sentenced to death she challenges gunther to three athletic contests throwing a javelin tossing a boulder and a leap after seeing the boulder and javelin it becomes apparent to the group that br nhild is immensely strong and they fear for their lives siegfried quietly returns to the boat his group arrived on and takes his special cloak which renders him invisible and gives him the strength of men chapters siegfried with his immense strength invisibly leads gunther through the trials unknowingly deceived the impressed br nhild thinks king gunther not siegfried defeated her and agrees to marry gunther gunther becomes afraid that br nhild may yet be planning to kill them so siegfried goes to nibelungenland and single handedly conquers the kingdom siegfried makes them his vassals and returns with a thousand of them himself going ahead as messenger the group of burgundians gunther and gunthers new wife to be br nhild return to worms where a grand reception awaits them and they marry to much fanfare siegfried and kriemhild are also then married with gunthers blessings however on their wedding night br nhild suspects something is amiss with her situation particularly suspecting siegfried as a potential cause gunther attempts to sleep with her and with her great strength she easily ties him up and leaves him that way all night after he tells siegfried of this siegfried again offers his help proposing that he slip into their chamber at night with his invisibility cloak and silently beat br nhild into submission gunther agrees but says that siegfried must not sleep with br nhild siegfried slips into the room according to plan and after a difficult and violent struggle an invisible siegfried defeats br nhild siegfried then takes her ring and belt which are symbols of defloration here it is implied that siegfried sleeps with br nhild despite gunthers request afterwards br nhild no longer possesses her once great strength and says she will no longer refuse gunther siegfried gives the ring and belt to his own newly wed kriemhild in chapter ten years later br nhild still feeling as if she had been lied to goads gunther into inviting siegfried and kriemhild to their kingdom br nhild does this because she is still under the impression that gunther married off his sister to a low ranking vassal while gunther and siegfried are in reality of equal rank yet the normal procedures are not being followed between the two ranks combined with her lingering feelings of suspicion both siegfried and kriemhild come to worms and all is friendly between the two until before entering worms cathedral kriemhild and br nhild argue over who should have precedence according to their husbands perceived ranks having been earlier deceived about the relationship between siegfried and gunther br nhild thinks it is obvious that she should go first through custom of her perceived social rank kriemhild unaware of the deception involved in br nhilds wooing insists that they are of equal rank and the dispute escalates severely angered kriemhild shows br nhild first the ring and then the belt that siegfried took from br nhild on her wedding night and then calls her siegfrieds kebse mistress or concubine br nhild feels greatly distressed and humiliated and bursts into tears the argument between the queens is both a risk for the marriage of gunther and br nhild and a potential cause for a lethal rivalry between gunther and siegfried which both gunther and siegfried attempt to avoid gunther acquits siegfried of the charges despite this hagen von tronje decides to kill siegfried to protect the honor and reign of his king although it is hagen who does the deed gunther who at first objects to the plot along with his brothers knows of the plan and quietly assents hagen contrives a false military threat to gunther and siegfried considering gunther a great friend volunteers to help gunther once again under the pretext of this threat of war hagen persuades kriemhild who still trusts hagen to mark siegfrieds single vulnerable point on his clothing with a cross under the premise of protecting him now knowing siegfrieds weakness the fake campaign is called off and hagen then uses the cross as a target on a hunting trip killing siegfried with a spear as he is drinking from a brook chapter sixteen this perfidious murder is particularly dishonorable in medieval thought as throwing a javelin is the manner in which one might slaughter a wild beast not a knight we see this in other literature of the period such as with parsifals unwittingly dishonorable crime of combatting and slaying knights with a javelin transformed into a swan in wagners opera further dishonoring siegfried hagen steals the hoard from kriemhild and throws it into the rhine rheingold to prevent kriemhild from using it to establish an army of her own kriemhild swears to take revenge for the murder of her husband and the theft of her treasure many years later king etzel of the huns attila the hun proposes to kriemhild she journeys to the land of the huns and they are married for the baptism of their son she invites her brothers the burgundians to a feast at etzels castle in hungary hagen does not want to go but is taunted until he does he realizes that it is a trick of kriemhild in order to take revenge and kill them all as the burgundians cross the danube this fate is confirmed by nixes who predict that all but one monk will die hagen tries to drown the monk in order to render the prophecy futile but he survives the burgundians arrive at etzels castle and are welcomed by kriemhild with lying smiles and graces but the lord dietrich of bern an ally of etzels advises the burgundians to keep their weapons with them at all times which is normally not allowed the tragedy unfolds kriemhild comes before hagen reproaches him for her husband siegfrieds death and demands the return of her nibelungenschatz hagen answers her boldly admitting that he killed siegfried and sank the nibelungen treasure into the rhine but blames these acts on kriemhilds own behaviour king etzel then welcomes his wifes brothers warmly but outside a tense feast in the great hall a fight breaks out between huns and burgundians and soon there is general mayhem when word of the fight arrives at the feast hagen decapitates kriemhilds and etzels little son before his parents eyes the burgundians take control of the hall which is besieged by etzels warriors kriemhild offers her brothers their lives if they hand over hagen but they refuse the battle lasts all day until the queen orders the hall to be burned with the burgundians inside all of the burgundians are killed except for hagen and gunther who are bound and held prisoner by dietrich of bern kriemhild has the men brought before her and orders her brother gunther to be killed even after seeing gunthers head hagen refuses to tell the queen what he has done with the nibelungen treasure furious kriemhild herself cuts off hagens head old hildebrand the mentor of dietrich of bern is infuriated by the shameful deaths of the burgundian guests he hews kriemhild to pieces with his sword in a fifteenth century manuscript he is said to strike kriemhild a single clean blow to the waist she feels no pain however and declares that his sword is useless hildebrand then drops a ring and commands kriemhild to pick it up as she bends down her body falls into pieces dietrich and etzel and all the people of the court lament the deaths of so many heroes

many people regarding the navidson record by navidsons wife karen and occasional brief notes by unidentified editors all woven together by a mass of footnotes there is also another narrator truants mother whose voice is presented through a self contained set of letters titled the whalestoe letters each narrators text is printed in a distinct font making it easier for the reader to follow the occasionally challenging format of the novel truant in courier new in the footnotes and the main narrative in times new roman in the american version zampan s narrative deals primarily with the navidson family will navidson a photojournalist partly based on kevin carter his partner karen green an attractive former fashion model and their two children chad and daisy navidsons brother tom and several other characters also play a role later in the story the navidson family has recently moved into a new home in virginia upon returning from a trip to seattle the navidson family discovers a change in their home a closet like space shut behind an undecorated door appears inexplicably where previously there was only a blank wall a second door appears at the end of the closet leading to the childrens room as navidson investigates this phenomenon he finds that the internal measurements of the house are somehow larger than external measurements initially there is less than an inch of difference but as time passes the interior of the house is found to be seemingly expanding while maintaining the same exterior proportions a third change asserts itself a dark cold hallway in their living room wall that physically should extend out into their yard but does not navidson films this strange place looping around the outside of the house to show where the space should be and clearly is not the filming of this anomaly comes to be referred to as the five and a half minute hallway this hallway leads to a maze like complex starting with a large room the anteroom which in turn leads to a truly enormous space the great hall a room primarily distinguished by an enormous spiral staircase which appears when viewed from the landing to spiral down without end there is also a multitude of corridors and rooms leading off from each passage all of these rooms and hallways are completely unlit and featureless consisting of smooth ash gray walls floors and ceilings the only sound disturbing the perfect silence of the hallways is a periodic low growl the source of which is never fully explained although an academic source quoted in the book hypothesizes that the growl is created by the frequent re shaping of the house there is some discrepancy as to where the five and a half minute hallway appears it is quoted by different characters at different times to have been located in each of the cardinal directions this first happens when zampan writes that the hallway is in the western wall house of leaves directly contradicting an earlier page where the hallway is mentioned to be in the northern wall house of leaves johnnys footnotes point out the contradiction navidson along with his brother tom and some colleagues feel compelled to explore photograph and videotape the houses seemingly endless series of passages eventually driving various characters to insanity murder and death ultimately will releases what has been recorded and edited as the navidson record will and karen purchased the house because their relationship was becoming strained with wills work related absences while karen was always adamantly against marriage claiming that she valued her freedom above anything else she always found herself missing and needing will when he was gone and yet even though karen keeps chad from overfilling the mold or daisy from cutting herself with the scissors she still cannot resist looking out the window every couple of minutes the sound of a passing truck causes her to glance away house of leaves zampan s narrative is littered with all manner of references some quite obscure others indicating that the navidsons story achieved international notoriety luminaries such as stephen king stanley kubrick douglas hofstadter ken burns harold bloom camille paglia hunter thompson anne rice and jacques derrida were apparently interviewed as to their opinions about the film however when truant investigates he finds no history of the house no evidence of the events experienced by the navidsons and nothing else to establish that the house or film ever existed anywhere other than in zampan s text many of the references in zampan s footnotes however are real existing both within his world and our world outside the novel for example several times zampan cites an actual time life book planet earth underground worlds house of leaves an adjacent story line develops in johnnys footnotes detailing what is progressing in johnnys life as he is assembling the narrative it remains unclear if johnnys obsession with the writings of zampan and subsequent delusions paranoia etc are the result of drug use insanity or the effects of zampan s writing itself johnny recounts tales of his various sexual encounters his lust for a tattooed stripper he calls thumper and his bar hopping with lude throughout various footnotes the reader also slowly learns more about johnnys childhood living with an abusive foster father engaging in violent fights at school and of the origin of johnnys mysterious scars house of leaves p nbsp more information about johnny can be gleaned from the whalestoe letters letters his mother pelafina wrote from the three attic whalestoe institution though pelafinas letters and johnnys footnotes contain similar accounts of their past their memories also differ greatly at times due to both pelafinas and johnnys questionable mental states pelafina was placed in the mental institution after supposedly attempting to strangle johnny only to be stopped by her husband she remained there after johnnys fathers death johnny claims that his mother meant him no harm and claimed to strangle him only to protect him from missing her etc it is unclear however if johnnys statements about the incident or any of his other statements for that matter are factual this story is included in an appendix near the end of the book as well as in its own self contained book with additional content included in the self contained version it consists of johnnys mothers letters to him from a psychiatric hospital the letters start off fairly normal but pelafina quickly descends into paranoia and the letters become more and more incoherent there are also secret messages in the letters which can be decoded by combining the first letters of consecutive words
The Whalestoe Letters,Mark Z. Danielewski,pelafina writes these letters to johnny from the three attic whalestoe institute a mental institution where she has been residing for a number of years while a number of these letters appear in house of leaves the whalestoe letters introduces a number of new letters which serve to more fully develop pelafinas character as well as her relationship with johnny

Survivor,Chuck Palahniuk,tender branson sits in the cockpit of a boeing telling his life story to the black box he is alone in the plane having hijacked it he has released all of the planes passengers and crew prior to this point he explains the events leading up to the hijacking tender is a member of the fanatical creedish cult which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously he is one of the creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant and send his income back to the creedish community creedish members have been steadily killing themselves since the mass suicide in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand at the start of his story tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in oregon they issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone in addition to cleaning tender gives the couple etiquette lessons over the phone and tends their garden which he does by planting fake flowers which he says is easier than planting real flowers and taking care of them at his dingy apartment he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline tender enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not and sees this as an act of mercy although the newspaper prints a retraction the calls keep coming and when they dwindle tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue one of the calls comes from a trevor hollis a man who wants to kill himself because of the nightmares he has been having about disasters like plane crashes or fires tender tells trevor to kill himself and soon after reads his obituary in the paper one day tender goes to the mausoleum to steal fake flowers for his employers garden a common pastime and decides to visit trevors tomb while he is there at the tomb he meets trevors sister fertility and they talk later that night tender has his weekly meeting with his caseworker from the federal survivor retention program a government agency that keeps tabs on the survivors of suicide cults as usual he asks how many survivors of the creedish faith there are remaining and she tells him one hundred and fifty seven survivors nationwide tender begins to explain how the creedish church works only the firstborn sons and their wives get to stay and reside in the community located in rural nebraska the rest like tender are sent out to work as humble servants and are considered to be the churchs missionaries they are extensively trained in etiquette housecleaning and other menial labor after which they are baptized and sent out into the world to make a living every month they are expected to send back money and a letter of confession tender is not really a name but a title which is given to all male children except the firstborn who is called adam likewise all female children are called biddy including the eldest tender is meant to denote one who tends biddy one who is biddable all but the firstborn sons and their wives are discouraged from having sex of any kind and are forbidden to marry and the latter are expected to have sex only for procreation all the creedish wear highly recognizable clothing both inside the community and out this makes it easy to spot another member of the church in the outside world tender further describes how ten years previously someone leaked the churchs doings i e cult brainwashing tax evasion unregistered births to the police of bolster county nebraska and the fbi are put on the case the fbi move in to arrest the cult leaders only to find the entire community dead in an act of mass suicide upon hearing the news the remaining survivors are expected to be prepared for such an event called the deliverance by the church and kill themselves as soon as they hear the news after their meeting fertility calls tender thinking she has called the crisis hotline tender soon realizes its fertility so he begins to talk to her in a fake voice because it is revealed later that fertility is psychic and knows everything it is understood that she knows at this point that she is speaking to tender she talks about her brothers suicide and how she met tender a pretty weird guy at the mausoleum mentioning how he reminded her of a creedish cult member and adding that he was extremely unattractive and she believed him to be trevors ex homosexual lover eventually she asks the man at the crisis hotline i e tender to have phone sex with her but he hangs up after turning her down he then stops answering his phone in fear that fertility will be on the other line wanting to have phone sex or growing more attracted to him as a mysterious voice than as a person during another meeting with his caseworker which regularly takes place at his employers house tender gets frustrated and tells her that if she wants to help him she can start by scrubbing the shower tiles burnt out over a decade of lost suicide cases the caseworker quickly grows obsessed with cleaning and soon takes over tenders job drifting more and more away from helping him confront his past she reveals at this time that many of the creedish suicides were really murders masked to look like suicides to encourage more survivors to kill themselves a week from their last meeting tender and fertility meet again at trevors tomb in the mausoleum fertility teaches him to dance while revealing that trevor had been psychic and all the things he had dreamt about had really happened at home tender receives a suspicious call from a man he recognizes as a member of the creedish church and he soon realizes that the murderer of creedish survivors is actually creedish himself the call scares him for he fears that he will be the next victim abruptly after the call fertility also calls tender again trying to reach the crisis hotline and she tells him about dancing with the man at the mausoleum and asks him to get together with her tender as the man at the crisis hotline agrees on the condition that she agrees to take the man from the mausoleum i e him out on a date she agrees on their date tender and fertility ride the bus downtown where a stranger rudely begins telling them facile jokes pointed at the creedish mass suicide tender laughs at all the jokes secretly wondering if the joker can tell hes creedish fertility snaps at the joker for making fun of suicide when the joker rises to exit the bus tender recognizes the mans pants as creedish dress and suddenly recognizes the man as adam his twin brother tender speaks adams name aloud but when adam asks if they are brothers he desperately denies it after the bus incident fertility takes tender to a department store that she presciently knows will catch on fire but that she knows will not harm them fertility explains that she has the same talent as her brother for dreaming the future tender soon learns that he has become one of the last two survivors of the creedish church the caseworker has him go over photos of dead creedish to see if he can identify the other survivor but he already knows it to be his brother adam he begins receiving phone calls from journalists and agents wanting his story the caseworker manages to suffocate on a chemical solution of ammonia and chlorine that she was using to clean the fireplace which had been secretly mixed together by adam and whose intended target was tender adam steals the caseworkers files on the creedish suicides immediately after the murder the police suspect tender but he claims innocence and slips away tender meanwhile calls an agent and takes a flight to new york that very night thus begins his road to stardom the agents company has been planning for years to turn the last survivor of the creedish cult into a religious celebrity they create a fake history for tender and completely overhaul his body he is given steroid injections health food teeth caps and is made to exercise and diet incessantly until he is the model of attractiveness it is made clear by the agent that no one will worship an ugly religious leader tender is entirely agreeable to all of it as he has no will to live and desires fame only in order to have an enormous audience for when he commits suicide as his agents plans are realized tenders fame grows these plans include the publication of tenders autobiography and the book of very common prayer as well as the conversion of the former creedish land into the tender branson sensitive materials sanitary landfill a repository for americas outdated porn tender is constantly waiting for the opportune moment to kill himself and continually puts it off as circumstances fail to meet his criteria then as his popularity starts to wane the agent tells him that he needs to perform a miracle in order to stay famous it is then that fertility finds tender and gives him a prediction to make on tv that will seem like a miracle when it comes true naturally it does and tenders fame swells to even greater proportions it is unclear at this point why fertility has shown up and decided to help this pattern goes on for some time until the super bowl comes up and tenders agent plans him an elaborate wedding to take place at half time following which tender will issue another miraculous prediction tender goes wandering around trying to meet up with fertility which he finally does in a mens bathroom where theyve taken adjacent stalls adam appears then with a gun and reveals that hes already laid a trap to kill tenders agent the same way he killed the caseworker so that tender would be suspect for both murders fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the super bowl and comes up with a plan for tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape adam intending this all along plans to escape with tender and fertility agreed on their course of action the three part the day of the super bowl the agent dies tender is married and as the police come to arrest him tender predicts that the colts will beat the cardinals the stadium erupts in a chaos as angry football fans pour out of their seats to chase tender and it is all the police can do to stop the crowd from mobbing him to death tender escapes with adam and fertility to a ronald mcdonald house the three then begin their journey across the country by hitching rides in semi trucks transporting incomplete sections of houses from one location to another during their journey fertility intentionally gets separated from the brothers adam and tender then steal a car that fertility foretold would be unlocked in a particular parking lot attached to the dashboard is a little commercial figurine of tender the brothers heading north to canada come to the tender branson sensitive materials sanitary landfill on the way as they drive through it adam begins recounting the way the church leaders terrorized the children into fearing sex by forcing them to watch every time a woman went into labor tender denies this but it is unclear whether he simply doesnt want to remember or whether he actually cant remember because the trauma is buried so deep in his memory adam believes the only way to cure tender is for tender to have sex to reject the church doctrine at its core tender resists and as adam recounts the details of the mental castration as he calls it tender loses control and crashes the car into a giant concrete pylon in the middle of the landfill the crash causes the airbags to deploy and the one on the passengers side sends the tender figurine into adams left eye adam pulls out the figurine and asks tender to find a rock and hit him with it tender refuses but adam asks him to find any rock that he can just to disfigure him with pleading that if he goes to jail for his murders he doesnt want the other inmates to even think about sexually abusing him tender reluctantly agrees to do this as long as adam will tell him when to stop but adam keeps telling him to swing again until it is too late and adam dies immediately afterwards fertility shows up in a taxicab and takes tender away from the landfill they go back to oregon and fertility plans to go on a quick job assignment to make some money fertilitys job is being a surrogate mother for couples who cant conceive fertility is actually a pseudonym her real name is gwen however fertility actually happens to be barren so her job is in essence prostitution the job she takes coincidentally happens to be for tenders former employers in the middle of the night tender sneaks into the house and fertility has sex with him in the guest bedroom for a short while for according to tender he only got in a few inches the next morning tender wakes up and fertility tells him that shes pregnant she then leaves for the airport to board a plane to sydney australia in her planner that she leaves behind tender reads that someone is going to hijack the plane and crash it into the australian outback following fertility to the airport tender finds her takes adams gun which she has stashed in an urn purportedly containing her brothers cremated remains and uses it to board the plane he then begins searching for the real hijacker until the joke dawns on him and he realizes that he is the hijacker the plot thus returns to the beginning with tender telling his life story he mentions that fertility told him there was a way for him to escape the plane before it crashes but on the record he cant seem to figure it out the book ends mid sentence but without any definitive answer as to whether tender lives or dies however it has been stated by the author that tender survives and an explanation is available on chuck palahniuks official website http www chuckpalahniuk net books survivor ending survivor

The Prince,Niccolò Machiavelli,the work has a recognizable structure for the most part indicated by the author himself which can be summarized as follows the prince starts by describing the subject matter it will handle in the first sentence machiavelli uses the word state italian stato which could also mean status in order to neutrally cover all forms of organization of supreme political power whether republican or princely the way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the renaissance has been the subject of many academic discussions with this sentence and similar ones in the works of machiavelli being considered particularly important machiavelli said that the prince would be about princedoms mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere possibly referring to the discourses on livy although this is debated but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also and one with many strengths more importantly and less traditionally he distinguishes new princedoms from hereditary established princedoms he deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in chapter saying that they are much easier to rule for such a prince unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him comparing to traditional presentations of advice for princes stated that the novelty in chapters and is the deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom normally these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes he thinks machiavelli may have been influenced by tacitus as well his own experience but finds no clear predecessor for this this categorization of regime types is also un aristotelian and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in aristotles politics which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch an oligarchy or by the people in a democracy he also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms for example between monarchy and tyranny points out that machiavelli frequently uses the words prince and tyrant as synonyms regardless of whether he speaks of criminal or non criminal tyrants xenophon on the other hand made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the opening of his education of cyrus where he says that concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings cyrus the great his exemplary prince was very different from all other kings both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts machiavelli divides the subject of new states into two types mixed cases and purely new states new princedoms are either totally new or they are mixed meaning that they are new parts of an older state already belonging to that prince machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous roman ways to hold a newly acquired province using a republic as an example of how new princes can act to install ones princedom in the new acquisition or to install colonies of ones people there which is better to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power to put down the powerful people not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation more generally machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones one should not enjoy the benefit of time but rather the benefit of ones virtue and prudence because time can bring evil as well as good in some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords th century france or in other words france as it was at the time of writing of the prince is given by machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom these are easy to enter but difficult to hold when the kingdom revolves around the king then it is difficult to enter but easy to hold the solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince machiavelli used the persian empire of darius iii conquered by alexander the great to illustrate this point and then noted that the medici if they think about it will find this historical example similar to the kingdom of the turk ottoman empire in their time making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than france would be notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to machiavellis project to unite italy which contained some free republics as he also notes the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince machiavelli gives three options ruin them like rome destroyed carthage and also like machiavelli says the romans eventually had to do in greece even though they had wanted to avoid it go to live there or install colonies if you are a prince of a republic let them keep their own orders but install a puppet regime but machiavelli says this way is useless princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources their virtue rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position this is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else because they are strong and more self sufficient they have to make fewer compromises with their allies machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely by contrast those who stand to benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises moreover it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybodys expectations inevitably he will disappoint some of his followers therefore a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts otherwise he will lose his power only armed prophets like moses succeed in bringing lasting change machiavelli claims that moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern allan gilbert wrote in wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them machiavelli was not himself an innovator because this idea was traditional and could be found in aristotles writings but machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim and gilbert associates machiavellis emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in italy according to machiavelli when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter because his power is dependent on his benefactors goodwill he does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim having risen the easy way it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet this is not necessarily true in every case machiavelli cites cesare borgia as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern through cunning political maneuvers he managed to secure his power base cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father pope alexander vi but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the orsini brothers and the support of the french king borgia won over the allegiance of the orsinis followers with better pay and prestigious government posts when some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him he had them imprisoned and executed when it looked like the king of france would to abandon him borgia sought new alliances finally machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries an idea allan gilbert said can be found in tacitus and seneca the younger conquests by criminal virtue are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel immoral deeds such as the execution of political rivals machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power and then execute them all in one stroke such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign in this way his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover princes who fail to do this who hesitate in their ruthlessness find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign thus they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people machiavellis case study is agathocles of syracuse after agathocles became praetor of syracuse he called a meeting of the citys elite at his signal his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens completely destroying the old oligarchy he declared himself ruler with no opposition so secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in africa remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows not only in its treatment of criminal behavior but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by aristotle in his politics a on the other hand gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter to give benefits when it will not appear forced was traditional these civic principalities do not require real virtue only fortunate astuteness machiavelli breaks this case into two basic types depending upon which section of the populace supports the new prince supported by the great those who wish to command the people this according to machiavelli is an unstable situation which must be avoided after the initial coming to power the great should be made and unmade every day at your convenience there are two types of great people that might be encountered those who are bound to the prince concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people those who are rapacious and those who are not it is the latter who can and should be honoured those who are not bound to the new prince once again these need to be divided into two types those with a weak spirit a prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel those who shun being bound because of their own ambition these should be watched and feared as enemies supported by the people those who wish not to be commanded by the great how to win over people depends on circumstances machiavelli advises do not get frightened in adversity one should avoid ruling via magistrates if one wishes to be able to ascend to absolute rule quickly and safely one should make sure that the people need the prince especially if a time of need should come the way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself or whether it needs to depend on allies this does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained a prince who is hated is also exposed this type of princedom refers for example explicitly to the catholic church which is of course not traditionally thought of as a princedom according to machiavelli these are relatively easy to maintain once founded they do not need to defend themselves militarily nor to govern their subjects machiavelli discusses the recent history of the church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer italy against other princes he points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the church and points to the recent example of the borgia family as a better strategy which almost worked he then explicitly proposes that the medici are now in a position to try the same thing having discussed the various types of principalities machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself the two most essential foundations for any state whether old or new are sound laws and strong military forces a self sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield he should be armed with his own arms however a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self sufficient if he cannot raise a formidable army but must rely on defense he must fortify his city a well fortified city is unlikely to be attacked and if it is most armies cannot endure an extended siege however during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all dissenters thus as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies a wise prince can withstand any siege machiavelli stands strongly against the use of mercenaries and in this he was innovative and he also had personal experience in florence he believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined cowardly and without any loyalty being motivated only by money machiavelli attributes the italian city states weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces troops borrowed from an ally because if they win the employer is under their favor and if they lose he is ruined auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer the main concern for a prince should be war or the preparation thereof not books through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom through this he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others for intellectual strength he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes a prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity machiavelli writes thus when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince however the advice is far from traditional machiavelli believes that a princes main focus should be on perfecting the art of war he believes that by taking this profession a ruler will be able to protect his kingdom he claims that being disarmed makes you despised he believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from ones soldiers is to understand military matters the two activities machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental physically he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories mentally he encouraged the study of past military events he also warns against idleness because says machiavelli he wants to write something useful to those who understand he thought it more fitting to go directly to the effectual truth verit effettuale of the thing than to the imagination of it this section is one where machiavelli s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly the prince should ideally be virtuous but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say and writes since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones also a prince may be perceived to be merciful faithful humane frank and religious but most important is only to seem to have these qualities a prince cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is necessary to act against them in fact he must sometimes deliberately choose evil although a bad reputation should be avoided it is sometimes necessary to have one if a prince is overly generous to his subjects machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated and will only cause greed for more additionally being overly generous is not economical because eventually all resources will be exhausted this results in higher taxes and will bring grief upon the prince then if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity he will be labeled as a miser thus machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity a wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous on the other hand of what is not yours or your subjects one can be a bigger giver as were cyrus caesar and alexander because spending what is someone elses does not take reputation from you but adds it to you only spending your own hurts you in addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared machiavelli writes the answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other but because it is difficult to combine them it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both as machiavelli asserts commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity however commitments made in fear are kept out of fear yet a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred which is very possible this chapter is possibly the most well known of the work and it is important because of the reasoning behind machiavelli s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved his justification is purely pragmatic as he notes men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared fear is simply a means to an end and that end is security for the prince the fear instilled should never be excessive for that could be dangerous to the prince above all machiavelli argues a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects their women or the life of somebody without proper justification regarding the troops of the prince fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard for a prince who leads his own army it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers absolute respect machiavelli compares two great military leaders hannibal and scipio africanus although hannibals army consisted of men of various races they were never rebellious because they feared their leader machiavelli says this required inhuman cruelty which he refers to as a virtue scipios men on the other hand were known for their mutiny and dissension due to scipios excessive mercy which was however a source of glory because he lived in a republic machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word however he also notes that a prince is also praised for the illusion of being reliable in keeping his word a prince therefore should only keep his word when it suits his purposes but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard therefore a prince should not break his word unnecessarily as machiavelli notes he should appear to be compassionate faithful to his word guileless and devout and indeed he should be so but his disposition should be such that if he needs to be the opposite he knows how as noted in chapter the prince must appear to be virtuous and should be virtuous but he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it that includes being able to lie though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful machiavelli observes that most men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women a prince should command respect through his conduct because a prince that is highly respected by his people is unlikely to face internal struggles additionally a prince who does not raise the contempt of the nobles and keeps the people satisfied machiavelli assures should have no fear of conspirators machiavelli advises monarchs to have both internal and external fears internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge external fears are of foreign powers machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories although it sometimes works often fails using fortresses can be a good plan but machiavelli says he shall blame anyone who trusting in fortresses thinks little of being hated by the people a prince truly earns honor by completing great feats king ferdinand of spain is cited by machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who in the name of religion conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel regarding two warring states machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side rather than to be neutral machiavelli then provides the following reasons why if your allies win you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have if you are more powerful then your allies are under your command if your allies are stronger they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help if your side loses you still have an ally in the loser machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so in conclusion the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously the selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince s intelligence so if they are loyal the prince is considered wise however when they are otherwise the prince is open to adverse criticism machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence the kind that understands things for itself which is excellent to have the kind that understands what others can understand which is good to have the kind that does not understand for itself nor through others which is useless to have if the prince does not have the first type of intelligence he should at the very least have the second type for as machiavelli states a prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself this chapter shows a low opinion of flatterers machiavelli notes that men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action but avoiding all advice flattery or otherwise was equally bad a middle road had to be taken a prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time all their opinions should be taken into account ultimately the decision should be made by the counselors and carried out absolutely if a prince is given to changing his mind his reputation will suffer a prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad machiavelli gives a negative example in emperor maximilian i maximilian who was secretive never consulted others but once he ordered his plans and met dissent he immediately changed them after first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one machiavelli says princes in italy who had long standing power and lost it can not blame bad luck but should blame their own indolence one should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up they all showed a defect of arms already discussed either had a hostile populace or else they did not know to secure themselves with the great as pointed out by it was traditional in the genre of mirrors of princes to mention fortune but fortune pervades the prince as she does no other similar work machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with sweat prudence and virtue even more unusual rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks and rise to power through their own labour virtue prudence and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk in a well known metaphor machiavelli writes that it is better to be impetuous than cautious because fortune is a woman and it is necessary if one wants to hold her down to beat her and strike her down gilbert p nbsp points out that machiavellis friend the historian and diplomat francesco guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season in periods of calm however people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact fortune machiavelli argues seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered as had recently been the case in italy as points out that what machiavelli actually says is that italians in his time leave things not just to fortune but to fortune and god machiavelli is indicating in this passage as in some others in his works that christianity itself was making italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics as if they would leave dangerous rivers un controlled pope leo x was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de medici family this chapter directly appeals to the medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer italy using italian armies following the advice in the book showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes but it is unusual that the medici familys position of papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base as a tool of secular politics indeed takes the borgia familys recent and very controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics often very brutally executed as a positive example this continues a controversial theme throughout the book

Satyricon,Petronius Arbiter,the work is narrated by its central figure encolpius a former gladiator the surviving sections of the novel begin with encolpius traveling with a companion and former lover named ascyltos who has joined encolpius on numerous escapades encolpius slave a boy named giton is apparently at encolpius lodging when the story begins giton is constantly referred to as brother throughout the novel thereby indicating that they were lovers in the first passage preserved encolpius is in a greek town in campania perhaps puteoli where he is standing outside a school railing against the asiatic style and false taste in literature which he blames on the prevailing system of declamatory education his adversary in this debate is agamemnon a sophist who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents encolpius discovers that his companion ascyltos has left and breaks away from agamemnon when a group of students arrive encolpius locates ascyltos and then giton who claims that ascyltos made a sexual attempt on him after some conflict the three go to the market where they are involved in a dispute over stolen property returning to their lodgings they are confronted by quartilla a devotee of priapus who condemns their attempts to pry into the cults secrets the companions are overpowered by quartilla and her maids who overpower and sexually torture them then provide them with dinner and engage them in further sexual activity an orgy ensues and the sequence ends with encolpius and quartilla exchanging kisses while they spy through a keyhole at giton having sex with a virgin girl and finally sleeping together this section of the satyricon regarded by classicists such as conte and rankin as emblematic of menippean satire takes place a day or two after the beginning of the extant story encolpius and companions are invited along with agamemnon to a dinner at the estate of trimalchio a freedman of enormous wealth who entertains his guests with ostentatious and grotesque extravagance after preliminaries in the baths and halls the guests mostly freedmen join their host and enter the dining room extravagant courses are served while trimalchio flaunts his wealth and his pretence of learning trimalchios departure to the toilet he is incontinent allows space for conversation among the guests encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbours about the weather about the hard times about the public games and about the education of their children in his insightful depiction of everyday roman life petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious millionaires of his age after trimalchios return from the lavatory the succession of courses is resumed some of them disguised as other kinds of food or arranged to resemble certain zodiac signs falling into an argument with agamemnon a guest who secretly holds trimalchio in disdain trimalchio reveals that he once saw the sibyl of cumae who because of her great age was suspended in a flask for eternity supernatural stories about a werewolf and witches are told following a lull in the conversation a stonemason named habinnas arrives with his wife scintilla who compares jewellery with trimalchios wife fortunata then trimalchio sets forth his will and gives habinnas instructions on how to build his monument when he is dead encolpius and his companions by now wearied and disgusted try to leave as the other guests proceed to the baths but are prevented by a porter they escape only after trimalchio holds a mock funeral for himself the vigiles mistaking the sound of horns for a signal that a fire has broken out burst into the residence using this sudden alarm as an excuse to get rid of the sophist agamemnon whose company encolpius and his friends are weary of they flee as if from a real fire encolpius returns with his companions to the inn but having drunk too much wine passes out while ascyltos takes advantage of the situation and seduces giton on the next day encolpius wakes to find his lover and ascyltos in bed together naked encolpius quarrels with ascyltos and the two agree to part but encolpius is shocked when giton decides to stay with ascyltos after two or three days spent in separate lodgings sulking and brooding on his revenge encolpius sets out with sword in hand but is disarmed by a soldier he encounters in the street after entering a picture gallery he meets with an old poet eumolpus the two exchange complaints about their misfortunes and eumolpus tells how when he pursued an affair with a boy in pergamon while employed as his tutor the youth got the better of him after talking about the decay of art and the inferiority of the painters and writers of the age to the old masters eumolpus illustrates a picture of the capture of troy by some verses on that theme this ends in those who are walking in the adjoining colonnade driving eumolpus out with stones encolpius invites eumolpus to dinner as he returns home encolpius encounters giton who begs him to take him back as his lover encolpius finally forgives him eumolpus arrives from the baths and reveals that a man there evidently ascyltos was looking for someone called giton encolpius decides not to reveal gitons identity but he and the poet fall into rivalry over the boy this leads to a fight between eumolpus and the other residents of the insula which is broken up by the manager bargates then ascyltos arrives with a municipal slave to search for giton who hides under a bed at encolpius request eumolpus threatens to reveal him but after much negotiation ends up reconciled to encolpius and giton in the next scene preserved encolpius and his friends board a ship along with eumolpus hired servant later named as corax encolpius belatedly discovers that the captain is an old enemy lichas of tarentum also on board is a woman called tryphaena by whom giton does not want to be discovered despite their attempt to disguise themselves as eumolpus slaves encolpius and giton are identified eumolpus speaks in their defence but it is only after fighting breaks out that peace is agreed to maintain good feelings eumolpus tells the story of a widow of ephesus at first she planned to starve herself to death in her husbands tomb but she was seduced by a soldier guarding crucified corpses and when one of these was stolen she offered the corpse of her husband as a replacement the ship is wrecked in a storm encolpius giton and eumolpus get to shore safely as apparently does corax but lichas is washed ashore drowned the companions learn they are in the neighbourhood of crotona and that the inhabitants are notorious legacy hunters eumolpus proposes taking advantage of this and it is agreed that he will pose as a childless sickly man of wealth and the others as his slaves as they travel to the city eumolpus lectures on the need for elevated content in poetry which he illustrates with a poem of almost lines on the civil war between julius caesar and pompey when they arrive in crotona the legacy hunters prove hospitable when the text resumes the companions have apparently been in crotona for some time a maid named chrysis flirts with encolpius and brings to him her beautiful mistress circe who asks him for sex however his attempts are prevented by impotence circe and encolpius exchange letters and he seeks a cure by sleeping without giton when he next meets circe she brings with her an elderly enchantress called proselenos who attempts a magical cure nonetheless he fails again to make love as circe has chrysis and him flogged encolpius is tempted to sever the offending organ but prays to priapus at his temple for healing proselenos and the priestess oenothea arrive oenothea who is also a sorceress claims she can provide the cure desired by encolpius and begins cooking while the women are temporarily absent encolpius is attacked by the temples sacred geese and kills one of them oenothea is horrified but encolpius pacifies her with an offer of money then oenothea tears open the breast of the goose and uses its liver to foretell encolpiuss future that accomplished the priestess reveals a leather dildo and the women apply various irritants to him which they use to prepare encolpius for anal penetration encolpius flees from oenothea and her assistants in the following chapters chrysis herself falls in love with encolpius an aging legacy huntress called philomela places her son and daughter with eumolpus ostensibly for education eumolpus makes love to the daughter although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of corax encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence he warns eumolpus that because the wealth he claims to have has not appeared the patience of the legacy hunters is running out eumolpus will is read to the legacy hunters who apparently now believe he is dead and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body in the final passage preserved historical examples of cannibalism are cited
"Guns, Germs, and Steel",Jared Diamond,the prologue opens with an account of diamonds conversation with yali a new guinean politician the conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between yalis people and the europeans who dominated the land for years differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of europeans yali asked using the local term cargo for inventions and manufactured goods why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea but we black people had little cargo of our own p nbsp diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere people of eurasian origin dominate the world in wealth and power other peoples after having thrown off colonial domination still lag in wealth and power still others he says have been decimated subjugated and in some cases even exterminated by european colonialists p nbsp the peoples of other continents sub saharan africans native americans aboriginal australians and new guineans and the original inhabitants of tropical southeast asia have been largely conquered displaced and in some extreme cases referring to native americans aboriginal australians and south africas indigenous khoisan peoples largely exterminated by farm based societies such as eurasians and bantu he believes this is due to the societies military and political advantages stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last ice age he proposes explanations to account for such disproportionate distributions of power and achievements the books title is a reference to the means by which farm based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance despite sometimes being vastly out numbered nbsp superior weapons provided immediate military superiority guns eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations who had no immunity making it easier to maintain control over them germs and centralized government promoted nationalism and powerful military organizations steel the book uses geography to show how europeans developed such superior military technology and how europeans and asians developed some immunity to diseases which spread among them while epidemics of them devastated the indigenous populations in the americas after european contact eurasia was the beneficiary of favorable geographic climatic and environmental characteristics particularly after the last ice age about years ago diamond argues that eurasian civilization is not so much a product of ingenuity but of opportunity and necessity that is civilization is not created out of superior intelligence but is the result of a chain of developments each made possible by certain preconditions in our earliest societies humans lived as hunter gatherers the first step towards civilization is the move from hunter gatherer to agriculture with the domestication and farming of wild crops and animals agricultural production leads to food surpluses which supports sedentary societies specialization of craft rapid population growth and specialization of labor large societies tend to develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies which may lead in turn to the organization of nation states and empires although agriculture arose in several parts of the world eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication in particular eurasia had the best collection of plants and animals suitable for domestication nbsp barley two varieties of wheat and three protein rich pulses for food flax for textiles goats sheep and cattle provided meat leather glue by boiling the hooves and bones and in the case of sheep wool as early middle eastern civilizations began to trade they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories most notably horses and donkeys for use in transport in contrast native american farmers had to struggle to develop maize as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor teosinte moreover it provides few nutrients and must be planted one by one nbsp an extremely cumbersome task eurasians had wheat and barley which are high in fiber and nutrients and can be sown en masse with just a toss of the hand they generated food surpluses which supported greater population growth such growth led to larger workforces and more inventors artisans etc grains can also be stored for longer periods of time unlike tropical crops such as bananas eurasia as a whole domesticated species of large animals over nbsp lb nbsp kg south america just one counting the llama and alpaca as breeds within the same species the rest of the world none at all diamond describes the small number of domesticated species out of candidates as an instance of the anna karenina principle many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication sub saharan africans had mostly wild mammals whereas eurasians chanced to have the most docile large animals on the planet horses and camels that are easily tamed for human transport but their biological relatives zebras and onagers are untameable and although african elephants can be tamed it is very difficult to breed them in captivity goats and sheep for hides clothing and cheese cows for milk bullocks for tilling fields and transport and benign animals such as pigs and chickens africans developing alongside large mammals had available lions leopards etc diamond points out that the only animals useful for human survival and purposes in new guinea came from the east asian mainland when they were transplanted during the austronesian settlement some years ago eurasias large landmass and long east west distance increased these advantages its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases its east west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons in contrast australia suffered from a lack of useful animals due to extinction probably by human hunting shortly after the end of the pleistocene the americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one latitude for use at other latitudes and in north america adapting crops from one side of the rocky mountains to the other africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south plants and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished because they could not survive the intervening environment europe was the ultimate beneficiary of eurasias east west orientation in the first millennium bc the mediterranean areas of europe adopted the middle easts animals plants and agricultural techniques in the first millennium ad the rest of europe followed suit the plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made division of labor possible the rise of non farming specialists such as craftsmen and scribes accelerated economic growth and technological progress these economic and technological advantages eventually enabled europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the books title eurasias dense populations high levels of trade and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases including from animals to humans natural selection forced eurasians to develop immunity to a wide range of pathogens when europeans made contact with america european diseases to which they had no immunity ravaged the indigenous american population rather than the other way around the trade in diseases was a little more balanced in africa and southern asia endemic malaria and yellow fever made these regions notorious as the white mans grave and syphilis may have spread in the opposite directionthe origin of syphilis is still debated some researchers think it was known to hippocrates others think it was brought from the americas by columbus and his successors the european diseases nbsp the germs of the books title nbsp decimated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of europeans could maintain their dominance guns germs and steel also offers a very brief explanation of why western european societies rather than other powers such as china have been the dominant colonizers other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large monolithic isolated empires in these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist nbsp until europeans arrived china was a very notable example in a new emperor outlawed the building of ocean going ships in which china was the world leader at the time europes geography favored balkanization into smaller closer nation states as its many natural barriers mountains rivers provide defensible borders as a result governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out competed relatively quickly as an example of this national darwinism diamond offers the disappearance of the counter progressive polish regime he argues that geographical factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change spain succeeded by france and then by england than was possible elsewhere in eurasia diamond examined european dominance in more detail with further examples in a later article
A Passage to India,E. M. Forster,a young british schoolmistress adela quested and her elderly friend mrs moore visit the fictional city of chandrapore british india adela is to marry mrs moores son ronny heaslop the city magistrate meanwhile dr aziz a young indian muslim physician is dining with two of his indian friends and conversing about whether it is possible to be friends with an englishman during the meal a summons arrives from major callendar azizs unpleasant superior at the hospital aziz hastens to callendars bungalow as ordered but is delayed by a flat tyre and difficulty in finding a tonga and the major has already left in a huff disconsolate aziz walks down the road toward the railway station when he sees his favourite mosque a rather ramshackle but beautiful structure he enters on impulse he sees a strange englishwoman there and angrily yells at her not to profane this sacred place the woman who turns out to be mrs moore has respect for native customs she had taken off her shoes before entering and she acknowledged that god is here in the mosque disarms aziz and the two chat and part as friends mrs moore returns to the british club down the road and relates her experience at the mosque ronny heaslop her son initially thinks she is talking about an englishman and becomes indignant when he learns the facts he thinks she should have indicated by her tone that it was a mohammedan who was in question adela however is intrigued because the newcomers had expressed a desire to see indians mr turton the city tax collector invites numerous indian gentlemen to a party at his house the party turns out to be an awkward business thanks to the indians timidity and the britons bigotry but adela does meet cyril fielding headmaster of chandrapores government run college for indians fielding invites adela and mrs moore to a tea party with him and a hindu brahmin professor named narayan godbole on adelas request he extends his invitation to dr aziz at fieldings tea party everyone has a good time conversing about india and fielding and aziz even become great friends aziz buoyantly promises to take mrs moore and adela to see the marabar caves a distant cave complex that everyone talks about but no one seems to actually visit azizs marabar invitation was one of those casual promises that people often make and never intend to keep ronny heaslop arrives and rudely breaks up the party aziz mistakenly believes that the women are really offended that he has not followed through on his promise and arranges the outing at great expense to himself fielding and godbole were supposed to accompany the little expedition but they miss the train aziz and the women begin to explore the caves in the first cave however mrs moore is overcome with claustrophobia for the cave is dark and azizs retinue has followed her in the press of people nearly smothers her but worse than the claustrophobia is the echo no matter what sound one makes the echo is always boum disturbed by the echo mrs moore declines to continue exploring so adela and aziz accompanied by a single guide a local man climb on up the hill to the next cluster of caves as aziz helps adela up the hill she innocently asks him whether he has more than one wife disconcerted by the bluntness of the remark he ducks into a cave to compose himself when he comes out he finds the guide sitting alone outside the caves the guide says adela has gone into one of the caves by herself aziz looks for her in vain deciding she is lost he angrily punches the guide who runs away aziz looks around again and discovers adelas field glasses similar to binoculars lying broken on the ground he puts them in his pocket then aziz looks down the hill and sees adela speaking to another young englishwoman miss derek who has arrived with fielding in a car aziz runs down the hill and greets fielding effusively but miss derek and adela have already driven off without a word of explanation fielding mrs moore and aziz return to chandrapore on the train then the blow falls at the train station dr aziz is arrested and charged with sexually assaulting adela in a cave she reports the alleged incident to the british authorities the run up to azizs trial for attempted sexual assault releases the racial tensions between the british and the indians adela accuses aziz only of trying to touch her she says that he followed her into the cave and tried to grab her and that she fended him off by swinging her field glasses at him she remembers him grabbing the glasses and the strap breaking which allowed her to get away the only actual evidence the british have is the field glasses in the possession of dr aziz despite this the british colonists firmly believe that aziz is guilty at the back of all their minds is the conviction that all darker peoples lust after white women they are stunned when fielding proclaims his belief in azizs innocence fielding is ostracized and condemned as a blood traitor but the indians who consider the assault allegation a fraud aimed at ruining their communitys reputation welcome him during the weeks before the trial mrs moore is unexpectedly apathetic and irritable her experience in the cave seems to have ruined her faith in humanity although she curtly professes her belief in azizs innocence she does nothing to help him ronny alarmed by his mothers assertion that aziz is innocent decides to arrange for her return by ship to england before she can testify to this effect at the trial mrs moore dies during the voyage her absence from india becomes a major issue at the trial where azizs legal defenders assert that her testimony alone had it been available would have proven the accuseds innocence after an initial period of fever and weeping adela becomes confused as to azizs guilt at the trial she is asked point blank whether aziz sexually assaulted her she asks for a moment to think before replying she has a vision of the cave in that moment and it turns out that adela had while in the cave received a shock similar to mrs moores the echo had disconcerted her so much that she temporarily became unhinged she ran around the cave fled down the hill and finally sped off with miss derek at the time adela mistakenly interpreted her shock as an assault by aziz who personifies the india that has stripped her of her psychological innocence but he was never there she admits that she was mistaken the case is dismissed note that in the draft of the novel em forster originally had aziz guilty of the assault and found guilty in the court but later changed this in the draft to create a more ambiguous ending all the english are shocked and infuriated by what they view as adelas betrayal of the white race ronny heaslop breaks off their engagement adela stays at fieldings house until her passage on a boat to england is arranged after explaining to fielding that the echo was the cause of the whole business she departs india never to return although he is free and vindicated aziz is angry and bitter that his friend fielding would befriend adela after she nearly ruined his life believing it to be the gentlemanly thing to do fielding convinces aziz not to seek monetary redress from her the two mens friendship suffers in consequence and fielding soon departs for england aziz believes that he is leaving to marry adela for her money bitter at his friends perceived betrayal he vows never again to befriend a white person aziz moves to the hindu ruled state of mau and begins a new life two years later fielding returns to india and to aziz his wife is stella mrs moores daughter from a second marriage aziz now the rajas chief physician at first persists in his anger against his old friend but in time he comes to respect and love

seriously assault dr gunn in their search for narcotics and goods some in fort repose discover faith others degenerate into drunkenness randy eventually learns that as an active army reserve officer he has the legal right to exercise martial law shortly after he had already begun to do so albeit in a de facto mode the authority comes from an order of acting chief executive josephine vanbruuker

in the death of his wife raskolnikov is at this point completely torn he is urged by sonya to confess and svidriga lovs testimony could potentially convict him furthermore porfiry confronts raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him confession would substantially lighten his sentence meantime svidriga lov attempts to seduce avdotya but when he realizes that she will never love him

confess the epilogue tells of how raskolnikov is sentenced to penal servitude in siberia where sonya follows him avdotya and razumikhin marry and are left in a happy position by the end of the novel

The End of Eternity,Isaac Asimov,the eternity of the title is an organization and a place which exists outside time it is staffed by male humans called eternals who are recruited from different eras of human history commencing with the twenty seventh century the eternals are capable of traveling upwhen and downwhen within eternity and entering the conventional temporal world at almost any point of their choice apart from a section of the far future which they cannot enter collectively they form a corps of platonic guardians who carry out carefully calculated and planned strategic minimum actions called reality changes within the temporal world in order to minimize human suffering as integrated over the whole of future human history as the plot unfolds however it is increasingly evident that eternity itself suffers from serious maladjustments the eternals feel an unspoken collective guilt which causes them to scapegoat the technicians the experts who actually execute reality changes by doing something that will alter the flow of events the eternals are also troubled that beyond a certain point in the future they are blocked by unknown means from entering time these are the hidden centuries beyond the hidden centuries they can emerge but find the earth devoid of human life a key plot element which emerges quickly as the story unfolds is the relatively static nature of the human societies in the various future centuries and the repeated failure of space travel in all accessible centuries we later learn that laban twissell harlan s superior and the leading figure on the governing council is from a century in the s yet nothing much is different in that time the protagonist is a technician named andrew harlan who finds himself involved in an ontological paradox orchestrated by his superiors he is to secure the creation of eternity by sending a young eternal back in time with the mathematical knowledge to make it possible to facilitate this harlans superiors in eternity allow him to pursue his study of prehistory which is history prior to the eternitys creation that because eternity had not yet been created then cannot be traveled to nor changed this intellectual pursuit is largely frowned upon by the eternals especially harlans superiors but it becomes apparent his expert knowledge on the subject will be vital to eternitys creation harlan himself is in trouble with the leaders of eternity he has been entrapped by one of them into entering into a relationship with a non eternal woman no s lambent this was intended merely to prove a point about the effect of eternity on the individuals from real time who learn of it but it has the unintended consequence of making harlan besotted with the woman so much so that he smuggles her into eternity since he has discovered that she will cease to exist in real time when the eternals make their next reality change harlan s whole scheme comes apart when it is revealed the leaders are fully aware of his activities normally the eternals traverse from century to century within eternity in a kind of temporal elevator called a kettle a special version of the kettle has been built however for harlan to dispatch a young eternal one brinsley sheridan cooper back to the th century which lies beyond the downwhen terminus accessible via eternity and its kettle system cooper is carefully instructed that he is to teach the principles and technology of time travel to its historic inventor vikkor mallansohn but unbeknownst to cooper or harlan he will actually become mallansohn himself however harlan filled with malice after erroneously concluding that twissell has trapped him and will deprive him of no s scrambles the time settings just as the special kettle departs cooper is trapped in the wrong time so eternity cannot be created unless something is done to change the past harlan s reality and eternity will be erased from existence twissell reveals that he too had once improperly loved a woman in time and manages to persuade harlan that he sympathizes calming down harlan tries to think of a way that cooper also adept in the concept of reality change could send him a message to return and retrieve him harlan believes that the apparently random target setting he chose on the kettle was the th century and it occurs to him that cooper was interested in his collection of artifacts from that time particularly magazines perhaps the trapped cooper would have found a way of leaving his sos message in one of them this is where asimov s mistaken mushroom cloud appears in the novel harlan comes upon an ad for stock tips all the talk of the market concealing the acrostic a t o m accompanying a drawing of a mushroom cloud the year on the masthead of the preserved publication is since this predates the first atomic explosion it must be a coded message from someone from the future a reality change caused by cooper before he reveals this discovery to the other eternals harlan exacts a price his lover is to be returned to him and both will go back to rescue cooper once the couple arrive in harlan reveals his last surprise he has deduced that the woman no s lambent is herself an agent of reality change she is from those centuries the eternals cannot enter she does not deny it instead she tells harlan that her people who prefer to watch past time rather than travel in it or change it discovered that eternity was in choosing safety for humanity suppressing creativity in the end this has the effect of denying humanitys access to the stars as alien species advance technologically and confine humanity to earth eventually humanity will die out millions of years in the future leaving an empty earth however if eternity could be prevented from being created humans would leave earth and colonize the stars thus they cut themselves off from eternity and began to plot its demise it was not any specific change but the very existence of any such organization as eternity which had the deleterious effect since when given the choice humanity would always choose safety no s lambent reveals that in order to make eternity improbable harlan needs only to decide to leave cooper stranded in she also intends to send a carefully worded letter to italy causing a man presumably enrico fermi to begin experimenting with the neutronic bombardment of uranium this will start a chain of events which will lead to the first atom bomb in in the reality known up to that point atomic power was discovered somewhat later it is not explained when but the th century had nuclear reactors and no nuclear bombs were detonated until the th century acquiring the technology sooner humanity will be diverted to focus more on the science of nucleonics and therefore develop interstellar space travel instead of time travel technology and leading to a galactic empire instead of eternity harlan at first intends to kill no s and carry out his mission but in comparing her story to that of the freakish and occasionally inhuman eternals he has encountered harlan confirms his lingering suspicions that eternity has been wrong for humanity at the very moment he decides to help her a reality change occurs and the kettle linking them with eternity vanishes into thin air

misunderstandings but the couples pierre and natasha nikolai and maria remain devoted to their spouses pierre and natasha visit bald hills in much to the jubilation of everyone concerned there is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic boyish nikolenka and pierre would both become part of the decembrist uprising the first epilogue concludes with nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father would be satisfied presumably as a revolutionary in the decembrist revolt the second part of the epilogue contains tolstoys critique of all existing forms of mainstream history while most historians claim that historical events are the result of the actions of heroes and other great individuals tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events rather he argues great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved he compares this to calculus and the sum of infinitesimals he then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free will necessity being based on reason and therefore explainable by historical analysis and free will being based on consciousness and therefore inherently unpredictable
On the Beach,Nevil Shute,the story is set primarily in and around melbourne australia in world war iii has devastated most of the populated world polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout and killing all human and animal life in the northern hemisphere the war began with a nuclear attack by albania on italy and then escalated with the bombing of the united states and the united kingdom by egypt because the aircraft used in these attacks were obtained from the soviet union the soviets were mistakenly blamed triggering a retaliatory strike on the ussr by nato there is also an attack by the soviets on the peoples republic of china which may have been a response to a chinese attack aimed at occupying soviet industrial areas near the chinese border most if not all of the bombs had cobalt that was included to enhance their radioactive properties global air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout across the intertropical convergence zone to the southern hemisphere the only parts of the planet still habitable are australia and new zealand south africa and the southern parts of south america although these areas are slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning as well life in melbourne continues in a reasonably normal fashion though the near complete lack of motor fuels makes travel difficult people in australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible morse code radio signal originating from seattle washington in the united states with hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions one of the last american nuclear submarines uss scorpion placed by its captain commander dwight towers under australian naval command is ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in melbourne australias southernmost major mainland city to contact whoever is sending the signal in preparation for this journey the submarine makes a shorter trip to port cities in northern australia including cairns queensland and darwin northern territory but finds no survivors two australians sail with the american crew peter holmes naval liaison officer to the americans and a scientist john osborne commander towers has become attached to a young australian woman distantly related to osborne named moira davidson who tries to cope with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking despite his attraction to davidson towers remains loyal to his wife and children in the united states he buys his children gifts and imagines their growing older at one point however he makes it clear to moira that he knows his family is almost certainly dead and he asks her if she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive she replies that she does not think he is crazy the australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and injections so that they can avoid prolonged suffering from radiation poisoning periodic reports show the steady southward progression of the deadly radiation as communications are lost with a city it is referred to as being out one of the novels poignant dilemmas is that of peter holmes who has a baby daughter and a naive and childish wife mary who is in denial about the impending disaster because he has been assigned to travel north with the americans peter tries to explain to marys fury and disbelief how to euthanize their baby and kill herself with the pill should he not return from his mission in time to help the bachelor osborne spends much of his time restoring a ferrari racing car which he had purchased along with a fuel supply for a nominal amount following the outbreak of the war the submarine travels to the gulf of alaska in the northern pacific ocean where the crew determines that radiation levels are not decreasing this finding discredits the jorgensen effect a scientific theory positing that radiation levels will gradually decrease due to weather effects and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern australia or at least antarctica the submarine approaches san francisco california observing through the periscope that the city had been devastated and the golden gate bridge has fallen in contrast the puget sound area from which the strange radio signals come is found to have avoided destruction due to missile defenses one crew member who is from edmonds washington which the expedition visits jumps ship to spend his last days in his home town the expedition members then sail to an abandoned navy communications school south of seattle a crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and protective gear discovers that although the citys residents have long since perished some of the regions hydroelectric power is still working due to primitive automation technology he finds that the mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key after a brief stop at pearl harbor the remaining submariners return to australia to live out what little time they have left the characters make their best efforts to enjoy what time remains to them speaking of small pleasures and continuing their customary activities the holmeses plant a garden that they will never see moira takes classes in typing and shorthand osborne and others organize a dangerous motor race that results in the violent deaths of several participants elderly members of a gentlemens club drink up the wine in the clubs cellar debate over whether to move the fishing season up and fret about whether agriculturally destructive rabbits will survive human beings towers goes on a fishing trip with davidson but they do not become sexually involved as he wants to remain loyal to his wife a decision moira accepts government services and the economy gradually grind to a halt in the end towers chooses not to remain and die with moira but rather to lead his crew on a final mission to scuttle the submarine outside australian territorial waters he refuses to allow his imminent demise to turn him aside from his duty to the u s navy and he acts as a pillar of strength to his crew moira watches the departure of the submarine from an adjacent hilltop as she takes her suicide pill imagining herself together with towers as she dies when mary holmes becomes very ill peter administers a lethal injection to their daughter even though he still feels relatively well he and mary take their pills simultaneously so they can die as a family osborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his beloved racing car typically for a shute novel the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not mope or indulge in self pity the australians do not for the most part flee southward as refugees but rather accept their fate once the lethal radiation levels reach the latitudes at which they live most of them opt for the government promoted alternative of suicide when the symptoms of radiation sickness appear

The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,Dorothy L. Sayers,ninety year old general fentiman has been estranged for years from his sister lady dormer on the afternoon of november he is called to her deathbed for a reconciliation and learns the terms of her will if she dies first he will inherit a fortune which his grandsons sorely need but if he dies first nearly all of the money will go to ann dorland a distant relative of lady dormers late husband she is a young woman with artistic leanings who lives with lady dormer lady dormer dies at am the next day which is november remembrance day that afternoon the general is found dead in his armchair at the club this produces a hysterical outburst from his younger grandson george fentiman a veteran of world war i still suffering from the effects of poison gas and shell shock due to the terms of lady dormers will and the time of her death it becomes necessary to establish the exact time of the generals death though the estate would provide amply for all three heirs ann dorland refuses any compromise settlement wimsey is asked to help solve the puzzle by his friend mr murbles the solicitor for the fentiman family wimsey agrees though he insists that he will pursue the exact truth regardless of who benefits the general was seated by an open fireplace so the temperature of the body is of no help the rigor mortis was well established indicating death much earlier than the discovery of the body but one knee was already limp unusual as rigor usually eases head and neck muscles first dr penberthy a former army surgeon and club member who was the first to see the body certified death by natural causes he was the generals personal physician and was treating him for a weak heart it would seem obvious that the general must have died sometime after arriving at the club on the morning of november since he was found later that day but nobody saw him arrive he went to the club at some point after visiting lady dormer the previous afternoon but his whereabouts are unknown between those two events his manservant says the general stayed out overnight and that a certain mr oliver called to say that the general would spend the night with him no one knows anything about oliver but the elder grandson robert fentiman says that hes seen him often at a popular italian restaurant robert agrees to watch for oliver and wimsey arranges for detectives to assist him robert thinks he sights oliver and follows him halfway across england but the man is not oliver at all wimsey also turns up a few clues there was a fresh tear in the generals trouser cuff and a scraping of paint on the side of his shoe wimsey locates the taxi driver who picked up the general at lady dormers house and another who took him to the bellona club the general went to see dr penberthy in between then en route to the club he had the taxi pick up george fentiman the two men had a long and angry discussion in the back of the taxi and then george got out wimsey also inquires into the character of ann dorland trying to learn why she wont compromise he contacts his old friend artist marjorie phelps who is also a good friend of ann dorland there is another sighting of oliver and this time robert and the detectives follow him to italy robert returns from italy and admits that oliver does not exist wimsey has figured out what happened there was no memorial poppy on the generals suitcoat impossible if he had been on the streets on remembrance day the general died at the club the evening before shortly after seeing his sister he had just told robert the terms of lady dormers will a few minutes later robert found his grandfather dead in the clubs library apparently of natural causes piqued at losing the inheritance he concealed the body overnight in the clubs telephone booth behind an out of order sign the generals cuff was torn by a nail inside the booth and the paint was scraped from its floor also the process broke the rigor mortis in one leg the next day robert moved the body to an armchair to be found later he acted when all the other members had stepped outside for the two minutes silence observed on remembrance day at am in the meantime wimsey has had the general exhumed and properly examined the general was poisoned with an overdose of the heart medication digitalis suspicion falls on ann dorland who was among the last persons to see the general and who has an obvious motive when she suddenly agrees to compromise with the fentimans it only adds to the suspicion then george fentiman has a nervous breakdown in an incoherent babble he claims to have poisoned his grandfather though this is clearly impossible wimsey eventually meets ann dorland who is miserable but it is not guilt that distresses her it is callous and humiliating treatment by her former lover dr penberthy they had been secretly engaged and he had insisted she fight for the whole estate and not compromise then after the autopsy he broke off with her giving highly insulting reasons penberthy had eyes on ann dorlands expected inheritance when general fentiman saw him he spoke of lady dormers will and penberthy realized that if the general didnt die at once ann dorland wouldnt collect so he gave the general a deliberate overdose of digitalis to be taken later when penberthy was not in attendance he was present next day when the body was discovered and so was able to certify a natural death though roberts intervention confused the time of death when the poisoning was discovered he panicked and broke off with ann dorland insulting her so that she would be too embarrassed to tell anyone wimsey confronts penberthy and offers him the chance to behave like a gentleman he cannot save himself but he can exonerate ann dorland from suspicion penberthy writes a confession and shoots himself in the club library in an epilogue it is revealed that the three heirs have divided the estate equitably in fact robert a bluff soldier who expressed distaste for artistic and intellectual women is now dating ann dorland

guest by the butler deacon and an accomplice cranton both men were imprisoned but the jewels were never recovered at easter sir henry himself dies and his wifes grave is opened for his burial a body is found hidden in the grave mutilated beyond recognition it is first thought to be the body of a tramp labourer calling himself driver who arrived and then vanished just after the new year an odd document found in the bell chamber by hilary thorpe sir henrys daughter proves to be a cipher acting on a hunch lord peter enquires at the post office for any uncollected letters addressed to driver bunter wimseys valet inveigles a postmistress into handing over a letter posted in france which confirms a link with the body which was wearing french underclothes the letter is addressed not to driver but to paul taylor a reference to tailor paul the tenor largest bell in the ring at fenchurch st paul when the writer of the letter is traced the dead man is assumed to be arthur cobbleigh a british soldier listed as missing in action but who evidently deserted and stayed in france after the war cobbleigh appears to have known where the emeralds were hidden and to have plotted to recover them probably with driver driver is discovered to be an alias of cranton the accomplice in the original theft wimsey assumes the two men did recover the emeralds and cranton then killed cobbleigh for them but cannot prove it however when he decodes the cipher which requires knowledge of change ringing it leads him to the emeralds still untouched in their hiding place in the church wimsey shows the cipher to mary thoday wills wife and deacons widow the thodays abscond to london wimsey guesses the true identity of cobbleigh and confirms this through the s ret in france he also discovers the thodays whereabouts through the archbishop of canterbury cranton is interviewed by wimsey and his brother in law detective inspector charles parker much becomes clear when cobbleigh turns out to have been deacon the thieving butler in he murdered a warder and escaped from prison a body apparently his was later found but in fact deacon had murdered a soldier and swapped identities with him he married bigamously in france and waited several years to return for the emeralds which he had hidden before his arrest since he risked hanging if caught he finally asked cranton to help sending him the cipher as a clue to the hiding place as a token of good faith cranton could not solve it but knew it related to the bells so he came to fenchurch as driver on new years day he went to the bell chamber on the night of january but found deacons dead bound body in the chamber and fled dropping the cipher parker then places a hidden microphone in the interview room where will thoday and his sailor brother jim are waiting it becomes apparent that both brothers thought that the other was guilty of killing deacon but were willing to take the blame themselves or at least shield the other when they are interviewed will relates that he encountered deacon who had come to retrieve the emeralds in the church on december will had married mary after the war believing her a widow now he realised deacon was still alive making his and marys marriage bigamous and their daughters illegitimate desperate to prevent deacon exposing his family to pain and scandal will tied him up in the bell chamber planning to bribe him to leave but became helpless with spanish influenza next day wills delirious talk led jim to find deacons body in the bell chamber on january he assumed that will had murdered him appalled but loyal he waited until the night after lady thorpes funeral on january made the body unrecognisable and hid it in the new grave then left for sea when the body was discovered will assumed jim had killed deacon neither can explain how deacon died both are released will marries mary again in bloomsbury under archbishops licence and returns to fenchurch st paul deacons death remains inexplicable it is only when wimsey returns to fenchurch the following christmas that he understands floods inundate the countryside and wimsey climbs the tower as the bells are ringing the alarm the appalling noise in the bell chamber convinces him that deacon tied there for hours between new years eve and new years day while wimsey helped with the all night peal could not have survived deacon was killed by the ringers or by the bells themselves will thoday is drowned in the flood trying to save another man who has fallen from a failing sluice gate wimsey speculates that will may not

for the purpose of protecting his mind against further invasions by lord voldemort during the lessons harry learns that a corridor he has been repeatedly visiting in his dreams is part of the department of mysteries harry is unsuccessful at occlumency because he has such difficulty clearing his mind of all thoughts making it difficult for him to focus on closing his mind off to all outside influence in addition to wanting to find out what they mean meanwhile his scar from the attack in which voldemort killed harrys parents burns horribly every time voldemort experiences a powerful emotion the d a continues to meet regularly and harrys peers show great improvement until they are caught by umbridge dumbledore takes full responsibility for the group and resigns as headmaster and umbridge takes over his position shortly afterwards harry ends up viewing a memory of snapes showing him being bullied by harrys father james and sirius back in their schooldays harry wishes

seized by slytherins and gagged hermione and harry convince umbridge to follow them into the forest where they claim to be hiding a weapon for dumbledore which they had just finished and wanted to tell him about once in the forest umbridge provokes the resident herd of centaurs and is taken into the forest by them harry and his friends use the schools thestrals winged skeletal horses to fly to the ministry once they arrive harry cannot find sirius and realises that hermione was right harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it as well as voldemorts harry grabs the sphere and death eaters led by lucius malfoy surround to attack demanding that harry hand over the prophecy employing all of their defence skills harry ron hermione ginny luna and neville have moderate success fighting the death eaters but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the order including dumbledore in the midst of the fight harry drops the glass

the fountain dumbledore appears shortly after voldemort and the two engage in an intense duel voldemort fights dumbledore to stalemate then possesses harry in an attempt to get dumbledore to sacrifice harry in the hope of killing him voldemort and lestrange escape just as fudge appears at the ministry finally faced with incontrovertible evidence that the dark lord has returned dumbledore sends harry back to school where after harry has a breakdown screaming that hes had enough of all the pain and anguish and death and destruction he explains that the sphere was a prophecy which stated that harry has a power that voldemort will never know the power of love given to him by his mothers sacrifice fifteen years earlier the prophecy goes on to claim that neither harry nor voldemort can live while the other survives dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell harry why he must spend his summers with the dursleys in little whinging because harrys mother died to save him he is blessed with her love a blessing that can be sealed only by blood harrys aunt petunia his mothers sister makes that bond complete by taking harry into her home as long as he still calls little whinging home harry is safe at the end of the year the order warn the dursleys they will have to answer to them should they mistreat harry who returns to them for the summer
Consciousness Explained,Daniel Dennett,the book puts forward a multiple drafts model of consciousness suggesting that there is no single central place a cartesian theater where conscious experience occurs instead there are various events of content fixation occurring in various places at various times in the brain the brain consists of a bundle of semi independent agencies when content fixation takes place in one of these its effects may propagate so that it leads to the utterance of one of the sentences that make up the story in which the central character is ones self dennetts view of consciousness is that it is the apparently serial account for the brains underlying parallelism one of the books more controversial claims is that qualia do not and cannot exist dennetts main argument is that the various properties attributed to qualia by philosophers qualia are supposed to be incorrigible ineffable private directly accessible and so on mdash are incompatible so the notion of qualia is incoherent the non existence of qualia would mean that there is no hard problem of consciousness and philosophical zombies which are supposed to act like a human in every way while somehow lacking qualia cannot exist so as dennett wryly notes he is committed to the belief that we are all zombies adding that his remark is very much open to misinterpretation dennett claims that our brains hold only a few salient details about the world and that this is the only reason we are able to function at all thus we dont store elaborate pictures in short term memory as this is not necessary and would consume valuable computing power rather we log what has changed and assume the rest has stayed the same with the result that we miss some details as demonstrated in various experiments and illusions some of which dennett outlines research subsequent to dennetts book indicates that some of his postulations were more conservative than expected a year after consciousness explained was published dennett noted i wish in retrospect that id been more daring since the effects are stronger than i claimed and since then examples continue to accumulate of the illusory nature of our visual world a key philosophical method is heterophenomenology in which the verbal or written reports of subjects are treated as akin to a theorists fiction the subjects report is not questioned but it is not assumed to be an incorrigible report about that subjects inner state this approach allows the reports of the subject to be a datum in psychological research thus circumventing the limits of classical behaviorism also dennett says that only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of unconscious events could explain consciousness at all to explain is to explain away

The Transparent Society,David Brin,brin argues that a core level of privacy protecting our most intimate interactions may be preserved despite the rapid proliferation of cameras that become ever smaller cheaper and more numerous faster than moores law he feels that this core privacy can be saved simply because that is what humans deeply need and want hence brin explains that the key question is whether citizens will be potent sovereign and knowing enough to enforce this deeply human want this means they must not only have rights but also the power to use them and the ability to detect when they are being abused ironically that will only happen in a world that is mostly open in which most citizens know most of what is going on most of the time it is the only condition under which citizens may have some chance of catching the violators of their freedom and privacy privacy is only possible if freedom including the freedom to know is protected first brin thus maintains that privacy is a contingent right one that grows out of the more primary rights e g to know and to speak he admits that such a mostly open world will seem more irksome and demanding people will be expected to keep negotiating the tradeoffs between knowing and privacy it will be tempting to pass laws that restrict the power of surveillance to authorities entrusting them to protect our privacy or a comforting illusion of privacy by contrast a transparent society destroys that illusion by offering everyone access to the vast majority of information out there brin argues that it will be good for society if the powers of surveillance are shared with the citizenry allowing sousveillance or viewing from below enabling the public to watch the watchers according to brin this only continues the same trend promoted by adam smith john locke the us constitutionalists and the western enlightenment who held that any elite whether commercial governmental or aristocratic should experience constraints upon its power and there is no power equalizer greater than knowledge

relationship will continue he threatens to take away seryozha if she persists in her affair with vronsky when anna and vronsky continue seeing each other karenin consults with a lawyer about obtaining

deems insufficient as proof of the affair stiva and dolly argue against karenins drive for a divorce karenin changes his plans after hearing that anna is dying after the difficult birth of her daughter annie at her bedside karenin forgives vronsky however vronsky embarrassed by karenins magnanimity unsuccessfully attempts suicide by shooting himself as anna recovers she finds that she

friends who will accept them whilst anna is happy to be finally alone with vronsky he feels suffocated they cannot socialize with russians of their own class and find it difficult to amuse themselves vronsky who believed that being with anna was the key to his happiness finds himself increasingly bored and unsatisfied he takes up painting and makes an attempt to patronize an migr russian artist of genius however vronsky cannot see that his own art lacks talent and passion and that his conversation about art is really pretentious increasingly restless anna and vronsky decide to return to russia in saint petersburg anna and vronsky stay in one of the best hotels but take separate suites it becomes clear that whilst vronsky is still able to move freely in russian society anna is barred from it even her old friend princess betsy mdash who has had affairs herself mdash evades her company anna starts to become anxious that vronsky no longer loves her meanwhile karenin is comforted by countess

at the invasion of so many scherbatskys he becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors veslovsky flirts openly with the pregnant kitty levin tries to overcome his feelings but eventually succumbs to them and makes veslovsky leave his house in an embarrassing scene veslovsky immediately goes to stay with anna and vronsky at their nearby estate when dolly visits anna she is struck by the difference between the levins aristocratic yet simple home life and vronskys overtly luxurious and lavish country estate she is also unable to keep pace with annas fashionable dresses or vronskys extravagant spending on a hospital he is building in addition all is not quite well with anna and vronsky dolly notices annas anxious behaviour and her uncomfortable flirtations with veslovsky vronsky makes an emotional request to dolly asking her to convince anna to divorce karenin so that the two might marry and live normally anna has become intensely jealous of vronsky and cannot bear it when he leaves her even for short excursions when vronsky leaves for several days of provincial elections anna becomes convinced that she must marry him in order to prevent him from leaving her after anna

accompanies stiva to a gentlemans club where the two meet vronsky levin and stiva pay a visit to anna who is occupying her empty days by being a patroness to an orphaned english girl levin is initially uneasy about the visit but anna easily puts him under her spell when he admits to kitty that he has visited anna she accuses him of falling in love with her the couple are later reconciled realising that moscow society life has had a negative corrupting effect on levin anna cannot understand why she can attract a man like levin who has a young and beautiful new wife but cannot attract vronsky as she did once her relationship with vronsky is under increasing strain as he can move freely in russian society while she remains excluded her increasing bitterness boredom and jealousy cause the couple to argue anna uses morphine to help her sleep a habit she had begun while living with vronsky at his country estate she has become dependent on it meanwhile after a long and difficult labour kitty gives birth to a son dmitri nicknamed mitya levin is both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny helpless baby stiva visits karenin to seek his commendation for a new post during the visit he asks him to grant anna a divorce which would require him to confess to a non existent affair but karenins decisions are now governed by a french clairvoyant recommended by lidia ivanovna the clairvoyant apparently had a vision in his sleep during stivas visit and gives karenin a cryptic message which is interpreted that karenin must decline the request for divorce anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards vronsky whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women she is also convinced that he will give in to his mothers plans to marry him off to a rich society woman they have a bitter row and anna believes the relationship is over she starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments in her mental and emotional confusion she sends a telegram to vronsky asking him to come home to her and then pays a visit to dolly and kitty annas confusion and vengeful anger overcome her and in a parallel to the railway workers accidental death in part she commits suicide by throwing herself in the path of an oncoming train levins brothers latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he joins the new pan slavic movement stiva gets the post he desired so much and karenin takes custody of vronskys and annas baby annie a group of russian volunteers including the suicidal vronsky depart from russia to fight in the orthodox serbian revolt that has broken out against the turks meanwhile a lightning storm occurs at levins estate while his wife and newborn son are outside and in his fear for their safety levin realizes that he does indeed love his son as much he loves kitty kittys family is concerned that a man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be a christian but after speaking at length to a peasant levin decides that devotion to living righteously is the only justifiable reason for living unable to tell anyone about this revelation levin is initially displeased that this change of thought does not bring with it a complete transformation to righteousness however at the end of the story levin comes to the conclusion that his new beliefs are acceptable and that other non christian religions contain similar views on goodness that are also entirely credible his life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward goodness

Foucault's Pendulum,Umberto Eco,the plot of foucaults pendulum revolves around three friends as relevant to the rule of three named belbo diotallevi and casaubon who work for a vanity publisher in milan after reading one too many manuscripts about occult conspiracy theories they decide they can do better and set out to invent their own conspiracy for fun they call this satirical intellectual game the plan as belbo diotallevi and casaubon become increasingly obsessed with the plan they sometimes forget that its just a game worse still when adherents of other conspiracy theories learn about the plan they take it seriously belbo finds himself the target of a very real secret society that believes he possesses the key to the lost treasure of the knights templar a number of sub plots are woven into the grand theme of the plan belbos obsession with the plan is justified by his experiences as a child in italy during world war ii his unrequited love for the mercurial lorenza pellegrini and his desire to absolve himself from a constant sense of failure against the backdrop of the templar plan for world domination the novel brings out the credulity inherent in all people the book opens with the narrator casaubon his name refers to classical scholar isaac casaubon and also evokes a scholar character in george eliots middlemarch hiding in fear after closing time in the parisian technical museum mus e des arts et m tiers he believes that members of a secret society have kidnapped belbo and are now after him most of the novel is then told in flashback as casaubon waits in the museum casaubon had been a student in s milan working on a thesis on the history of the knights templar while taking in the revolutionary and counter revolutionary activities of the students around him during this period he meets belbo who works as an editor in a publishing house belbo invites casaubon to review the manuscript of a supposedly non fiction book about the templars casaubon also meets belbos colleague diotallevi a cabalist the book by a colonel ardenti claims a hidden coded manuscript has revealed a secret plan of the medieval templars to take over the world this supposed conspiracy is meant as revenge for the deaths of the templar leaders when their order was disbanded by the king of france ardenti postulates that the templars were the guardians of a secret treasure perhaps the holy grail of legend which he suspects was a radioactive energy source according to ardentis theory after the french monarchy and the catholic church disbanded the templars on the grounds of heresy some knights escaped and established cells throughout the world these cells have been meeting at regular intervals in distinct places to pass on information about the grail ultimately these cells will reunite to rediscover the grails location and achieve world domination according to ardentis calculations the templars should have taken over the world in evidently the plan has been interrupted ardenti mysteriously vanishes after meeting with belbo and casaubon to discuss his book a police inspector de angelis interviews both men he hints that his job as a political department investigator leads him to investigate not only revolutionaries but also people who claim to be linked to the occult casaubon has a romance with a brazilian woman named amparo he leaves italy to follow her and spends a few years in brazil while living there he learns about south american and caribbean spiritualism and meets agli an elderly man who implies that he is the mystical comte de saint germain agli has a seemingly infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the occult while in brazil casaubon receives a letter from belbo about attending a meeting of occultists at the meeting belbo was reminded of the colonels conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently in a trance casaubon and amparo also attend an occult event in brazil an umbanda rite during the ritual amparo falls into a trance herself an experience she finds deeply disturbing and embarrassing as she is marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences her relationship with casaubon falls apart and he returns to italy on his return to milan casaubon begins working as a freelance researcher at the library he meets a woman named lia the two fall in love and eventually have a child together meanwhile casaubon is hired by belbos boss mr garamond his name refers to french publisher claude garamond to research illustrations for a history of metals the company is preparing casaubon learns that as well as the respectable garamond publishing house mr garamond also owns manuzio a vanity publisher that charges incompetent authors large sums of money to print their work rendered manutius in the english translation a reference to the th century printer aldus manutius mr garamond soon has the idea to begin two lines of occult books one intended for serious publication by garamond the other isis unveiled a reference to the theosophical text by blavatsky to be published by manutius in order to attract more vanity authors belbo diotallevi and casaubon quickly become submerged in occult manuscripts that draw all sorts of flimsy connections between historical events they nickname the authors the diabolicals and engage agli as a specialist reader the three editors start to develop their own conspiracy theory the plan as part satire and part intellectual game starting from ardentis secret manuscript they develop an intricate web of mystical connections they also make use of belbos small personal computer which he has nicknamed abulafia belbo mainly uses abulafia for his personal writings the novel contains many excerpts of these discovered by casaubon as he goes through abulafias files but it came equipped with a small program that can rearrange text in random compare with the game of dissociated press and ramon llulls ars magna they use this program to create the connections which inspire their plan they enter randomly selected words from the diabolicals manuscripts logical operators what follows is not true if then etc truisms such as the templars have something to do with everything and neutral data such as minnie mouse is mickey mouses fianc e and use abulafia to create new text their first attempt ends up recreating after a liberal interpretation of the results the mary magdalene conspiracy theory central to the holy blood and the holy grail casaubon jokingly suggests that to create something truly new belbo must look for occult connections in non obvious contexts such as by linking the kabbalah to a cars spark plugs belbo actually does this and after some research concludes that the powertrain is a metaphor for the tree of life pleased with the results of the random text program the three continue resorting to abulafia whenever they reach a dead end with their game the plan evolves slowly but the final version involves the knights templars coming into possession of an ancient secret knowledge of energy flows called telluric currents during the crusades the original knights templar organization is destroyed after the execution of jacques de molay but the members split into independent cells located in several corners of europe and the middle east as in ardentis original theory each cell is given part of the templar plan and information about the secret discovery they are to meet periodically at different locations to share sections of the plan gradually reconstructing the original then they will reunite and take over the world using the power of the telluric currents the crucial instruments involved in their plan are a special map and the foucault pendulum while the plan is far fetched the editors become increasingly involved in their game they even begin to think that there might really be a secret conspiracy after all ardentis disappearance and his original coded manuscript seem to have no other explanation however when casaubons girlfriend lia asks to see the coded manuscript she comes up with a mundane interpretation she suggests that the document is simply a delivery list and encourages casaubon to abandon the game as she fears it is having a negative effect on him when diotallevi is diagnosed with cancer he attributes this to his participation in the plan he feels that the disease is a divine punishment for involving himself in mysteries he should have left alone and creating a game that mocked something larger than them all belbo meanwhile retreats even farther into the plan to avoid confronting problems in his personal life the three had sent agli their chronology of secret societies in the plan pretending it was not their own work but rather a manuscript they had been presented with their list includes historic organizations such as the templars rosicrucians paulicians and synarchists but they also invent a fictional secret society called the tres templi resurgentes equites synarchici latin for the nonsensical synarchic knights of templar rebirth the tres is introduced to trick agli upon reading the list he claims not to have heard of the tres before the word was first mentioned to casaubon by the policeman de angelis de angelis had asked casaubon if he has ever heard of the tres belbo goes to agli privately and describes the plan to him as though it were the result of serious research he also claims to be in possession of the secret templar map agli becomes frustrated with belbos refusal to let him see this non existent map he frames belbo as a terrorist suspect in order to force him to come to paris agli has cast himself as the head of a secret spiritual brotherhood which includes mr garamond colonel ardenti and many of the diabolical authors belbo tries to get help from de angelis but he has just transferred to sardinia after an attempted car bombing and refuses to get involved casaubon receives a call for help he goes to belbos apartment and reads all the documents that belbo stored in his computer then decides to follow belbo to paris himself he decides that agli and his associates must intend to meet at the museum where foucaults pendulum is housed as belbo had claimed that the templar map had to be used in conjunction with the pendulum casaubon hides in the museum where he was when the novel opened at the appointed hour a group of people gather around the pendulum for an arcane ritual casaubon sees several ectoplasmic forms appear one of which claims to be the real comte de saint germain and discredits agli in front of his followers belbo is then brought out to be questioned agli s group are or have deluded themselves to be the tres society in the plan angry that belbo knows more about the plan than they do they try to force him to reveal the secrets he knows even going so far as to try to coerce him using lorenza refusing to satisfy them or reveal that the plan was a nonsensical concoction his refusal incites a riot during which lorenza is stabbed and belbo is hanged by wire connected to foucaults pendulum the act of his hanging actually changes the act of the pendulum causing it to oscillate from his neck instead of the fixed point above him ruining any chance of displaying any correct location the tres meant to find casaubon escapes the museum through the paris sewers eventually fleeing to the countryside villa where belbo had grown up it is unclear by this point how reliable a narrator casaubon has been and to what extent he has

administer the workhouse hypocritically offer five pounds to any person wishing to take on the boy as an apprentice a brutal chimney sweep almost claims oliver however when he begs despairingly not to be sent away with that dreadful man a kindly old magistrate refuses to sign the indentures later mr sowerberry an undertaker employed by the parish took oliver into his service he treats oliver better and because of the boys sorrowful countenance uses him as a mourner at children s funerals however mr sowerberry is in an unhappy marriage and his wife takes an immediate dislike to oliver primarily

of nancys ghost and increasingly alarmed by news of her murder spreading across the countryside he flees back to london to find a hiding place only to be killed when he accidentally hangs himself

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,John le Carré,the west berlin office of the british secret intelligence service under the command of station head alec leamas has been performing poorly at the commencement of the novel karl riemeck his last and best double agent a high ranking east german political officer is shot dead at the last moment whilst defecting to west berlin without any agents left the disgraced leamas is recalled to the circus in london by control chief of the circus there control asks leamas to stay in the cold for one last mission to turn defect and provide false information to the east german communists that would implicate mundt as a british double agent what his second in command fiedler already suspects to result in mundt being executed by his own people control tells leamas that fiedler due to his paranoia about mundt would be the best man to depose mundt george smiley and his former assistant peter guillam brief leamas for his crucial mission control tells leamas that smiley had not returned to the circus after the events of call for the dead because of moral qualms about unethical circus operations to make the east germans believe him ripe for defection the circus sacks leamas with a pittance of a pension and he gets a miserable job in a run down library and loses it at the library he meets co worker liz gold an unworldly young jewish woman who is the secretary of her local cell of the communist party of britain despite her politics they become lovers before taking the final plunge into controls scheme leamas makes liz promise not to look for him no matter what she hears and says good bye to her leamas also tells control to leave liz alone and control agrees then as planned leamas lands in jail after he assaults a local grocer after jail an east german recruiter in england approaches leamas he is taken abroad first to the netherlands then to east germany en route meeting higher echelons of the abteilung the east german intelligence service during his debriefing he drops casual hints that point to british payments to a double agent in the abteilung whilst pretending not to see the implications meanwhile in england george smiley and peter guillam appear at liz golds apartment claiming to be friends of alec question her about him and offer her financial help in east germany leamas meets fiedler they have many conversations in a hut in a forest clearing where fiedler seeks conclusive proof against mundt and engages in ideological and philosophic discussions with the pragmatic leamas as observed by leamas fiedler seems content to live in mundts shadow but is relatively young and brilliant to leamas fiedler is sympathetic a jew who spent the second world war in canada and a communist idealist who considers the morality of his actions in contrast leamas sees mundt as a brutal opportunist mercenary who was a nazi before and then joined the communists simply because they were the new bosses and remained an anti semite leamas believes helping fiedler destroy mundt is a worthy act meanwhile liz gold is invited to east germany for a communist party information exchange the power struggle in the abteilung comes into the open when mundt orders fiedler and leamas arrested and tortured however the leaders of the east german r gime intervene because fiedler had earlier applied for an arrest warrant for mundt on the same day that mundt arrested fiedler and leamas they are released and fiedler and mundt are summoned to present their cases to a tribunal convened in camera in the town of g rlitz at the trial alec leamas documents a series of secret bank account payments that fiedler matches to the movements of mundt fiedler also shows that karl riemeck passed to leamas information to which he had no formal access but to which mundt did fiedler also presents to the tribunal other proofs implicating mundt as a british double agent and explains that mundt was captured in england and allowed to escape only after agreeing to work as a double agent for the british mundt s attorney calls the unsuspecting liz gold as a surprise witness for the defence although not wanting to testify against alec leamas she admits that george smiley paid for her apartment lease after visiting her and that she had promised leamas to not look for him when he disappeared she also admits that he had said good bye to her the night before he assaulted the grocer realising that the operation is now blown leamas offers to tell all in return for lizs freedom he admits that control gave him the mission to frame mundt as a double agent but adds that fiedler was not a participant in cross examination fiedler asks mundt how he knew that someone had paid off lizs lease because fiedler insists liz never would have spoken about it mundt hesitates before answering a second too long leamas thought then the tribunal halts the trial and arrests fiedler then and only then does leamas understand the true nature of control and smileys operation liz is sent to a cell but mundt places her in a car with leamas at the wheel during their drive to berlin where an exit route from east berlin awaits he explains the operation to her including the parts of which he was unaware until the end of the trial the fake bank account payments were real and hans dieter mundt is a double agent reporting to george smiley and peter guillam the operation was against fiedler not mundt as leamas was deceived to believe because fiedler was close to exposing mundt as a british double agent fiedler was too powerful for mundt to eliminate alone therefore control and smiley did it for him they placed him and her as co workers to provide mundt with the means of discrediting leamas and consequently discrediting fiedler by falling in love leamas and liz made it easy for them liz is horrified that british intelligence planned the death of fiedler an intelligent considerate and thoughtful man in order to protect the despicable mundt fiedlers fate is unrevealed but leamas in answer to lizs question says that he would most likely be shot despite her moral disgust liz accompanies leamas to the break in the wire fronting the berlin wall where they are to climb the wall and escape to west berlin in the concluding chapter after leamas climbs to the top of the berlin wall and reaches down to pull liz up east german spotlights suddenly turn on them and she is shot her fingers slip from his grasp and she falls from the western side of the wall leamas hears a western agent calling to him

The Postman,David Brin,despite the post apocalyptic scenario and several action sequences the book is largely about civilization and symbols each of the three sections deals with a different symbol the first is the postman himself gordon krantz who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses everything but his sleeping clothes he wanders without establishing himself anywhere and acts in scenes of william shakespeare for supplies originally from minnesota he has traveled as far west as oregon taking shelter in a long abandoned postal van he finds a sack of mail and takes it to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter his reputation as a real postman builds not because of a deliberate fraud at least initially but because people are desperate to believe later in the second section he encounters a community corvallis oregon led by cyclops apparently a sentient artificial intelligence created at oregon state university which miraculously survived the cataclysm in reality however the machine had ceased functioning during a battle a group of scientists merely maintain the pretense of it working to try and keep hope order and knowledge alive eventually in the third section as the postman joins forces with the cyclops scientists in a war against an influx of hypersurvivalists he begins to find that the hypersurvivalists are being pressed from the rogue river area to the south as well the hypersurvivalists are more commonly referred to as holnists after the founder of their ideal nathan holn many times through the book curses are uttered which damn holn for his actions nathan holn was an author who championed an extreme violent misogynistic and hypersurvivalist society holn is said to have himself been hanged in the novel but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder followers of holn prevented the united states from recovering from the limited war and the plagues that followed as the story ends and he comes close to the hypersurvivalists southern enemy he begins to find traces of them primarily in the symbol that they rally behind the bear flag of california the final scenes give the impression that the three symbols may rally together in an effort to revive civilization another message of the plot deals with the backstory of the post apocalyptic world specifically that it was not the electronics destroying electromagnetic pulses nor the destruction of major cities nor the release of various bio engineered plagues that actually destroyed society rather it was the hypersurvivalists themselves those who maintained stockpiles of weapons and ammunition and who preyed on humanitarian workers and other forces of order

Murder on the Orient Express,Agatha Christie,hercule poirot boards the orient express in constantinople the train is unusually crowded for the time of year poirot secures a berth only with the help of his friend m bouc a director of the compagnie internationale des wagons lits when a mr harris fails to show up poirot takes his place on the second night poirot gets a compartment to himself that night in vinkovci at about twenty three minutes before am poirot wakes to the sound of a loud noise it seems to come from the compartment next to his which is occupied by mr ratchett when poirot peeks out his door he sees the conductor knock on mr ratchetts door and ask if he is all right a man replies in french ce nest rien je me suis tromp which means its nothing i was mistaken and the conductor moves on to answer a bell down the passage poirot decides to go back to bed but he is disturbed by the fact that the train is unusually still and his mouth is dry as he lies awake he hears a mrs hubbard ringing the bell urgently when poirot then rings the conductor for a bottle of mineral water he learns that mrs hubbard claimed that someone had been in her compartment he also learns that the train has stopped due to a snowstorm poirot dismisses the conductor and tries to go back to sleep only to be awakened again by a thump on his door this time when poirot gets up and looks out of his compartment the passage is completely silent and he sees nothing except the back of a woman in a scarlet kimono retreating down the passage in the distance the next day he awakens to find that ratchett is dead having been stabbed twelve times in his sleep m bouc suggests that poirot take the case being that it is so obviously his kind of case nothing more is required than for him to sit think and take in the available evidence however the clues and circumstances of ratchetts death are very mysterious some of the stab wounds are very deep only three are lethal and some are glancing blows furthermore some of them appear to have been inflicted by a right handed person and some by a left handed person poirot finds several more clues in the victims cabin and on board the train including a linen handkerchief embroidered with the initial h a pipe cleaner and a button from a conductors uniform all of these clues suggest that the murderer or murderers were somewhat sloppy however each clue seemingly points to different suspects which suggests that some of the clues were planted by reconstructing parts of a burned letter poirot discovers that mr ratchett was a notorious fugitive from the u s named cassetti five years earlier cassetti kidnapped three year old american heiress daisy armstrong though the armstrong family paid a large ransom cassetti murdered the little girl and fled the country with the money daisys mother sonia was pregnant when she heard of daisys death the shock sent her into premature labour and both she and the baby died her husband colonel armstrong shot himself out of grief daisys nursemaid susanne was suspected of complicity in the crime by the police despite her protests she threw herself out of a window and died after which she was proved innocent although cassetti was caught his resources allowed him to get himself acquitted on an unspecified technicality although he still fled the country to escape further prosecution for the crime as the evidence mounts it continues to point in wildly different directions and it appears that poirot is being challenged by a mastermind a critical piece of missing evidence ndash the scarlet kimono worn the night of the murder by an unknown woman ndash turns up in poirots own luggage after meditating on the evidence poirot assembles the thirteen suspects m bouc and dr constantine in the restaurant car he lays out two possible explanations of ratchetts murder the first explanation is that a stranger ndash some gangster enemy of ratchett ndash boarded the train at vinkovci the last stop murdered ratchett for reasons unknown and escaped unnoticed the crime occurred an hour earlier than everyone thought because the victim and several others failed to note that the train had just crossed into a different time zone the other noises heard by poirot on the coach that evening were unrelated to the murder however dr constantine says that poirot must surely be aware that this does not fully explain the circumstances of the case poirots second explanation is rather more sensational all of the suspects are guilty poirots suspicions were first aroused by the fact that all the passengers on the train were of so many different nationalities and social classes and that only in the melting pot of the united states would a group of such different people form some connection with each other poirot reveals that the twelve other passengers on the train and the train conductor were all connected to the armstrong family in some way hector macqueen ratchett cassettis secretary devoted to sonia armstrong macqueens father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case he knew from his father the details of cassettis escape from justice masterman ratchett cassettis valet was colonel armstrongs batman during the war and later his valet colonel arbuthnot was colonel armstrongs comrade and best friend mrs hubbard in actuality is linda arden n e goldenberg the most famous tragic actress of the new york stage and was sonia armstrongs mother and daisys grandmother countess andrenyi n e helena goldenberg was sonia armstrongs sister count andryeni was the husband of helena andrenyi princess natalia dragomiroff was sonia armstrongs godmother as she was a friend of her mother miss mary debenham was sonia armstrongs secretary and daisy armstrongs governess fr ulein hildegarde schmidt princess dragomiroffs maid was the armstrong familys cook antonio foscarelli a car salesman based in chicago was the armstrong familys chauffeur miss greta ohlsson a swedish missionary was daisy armstrongs nurse pierre michel the train conductor was the father of susanne the armstrongs nursemaid who committed suicide cyrus hardman a private detective ostensibly retained as a bodyguard by ratchett cassetti was a policeman in love with susanne all these friends and relations had been gravely affected by daisys murder and outraged by cassettis subsequent escape they took it into their own hands to serve as cassettis executioners to avenge a crime the law was unable to punish each of the suspects stabbed ratchett once so that no one could know who delivered the fatal blow twelve of the conspirators participated to allow for a twelve person jury with count andrenyi acting for his wife as she ndash daisys aunt ndash would have been the most likely suspect one extra berth was booked under a fictitious name ndash harris ndash so that no one but the conspirators and the victim would be on board the coach and this fictitious person would subsequently disappear and become the primary suspect in ratchetts murder the only person not involved in the plot would be m bouc for whom the cabin next to ratchett was already reserved the main inconvenience for the murderers was the occurrence of a snowstorm and the presence of a detective which caused complications to the conspirators that resulted in several crucial clues being left behind poirot summarizes that there was no other way the murder could have taken place given the evidence several of the suspects have broken down in tears as he has revealed their connection to the armstrong family and mrs hubbard linda arden confesses that the second theory is correct and that colonel arbuthnot and mary debenham are in love she then appeals to poirot m bouc and dr constantine not to turn them in to the police fully in sympathy with the armstrong family and feeling nothing but disgust for the victim bouc pronounces the first explanation as correct and poirot and dr constantine agree dr constantine suggesting that he will edit his original report of cassettis body to comply with poirots first deduction as he now recognizes some mistakes he has made his task completed poirot states he has the honour to retire from the case arrangement of the calais coach width cellpadding cellspacing style margin background color ffffff style text align center font size bgcolor f f dc style border right px

school supplies there with the weasleys harry encounters gilderoy lockhart a wizard famous for all manner of deeds who announces he is the new defense against the dark arts teacher and demands to be in a photo shoot with harry harry then encounters lucius malfoy a hogwarts governor and the father of the school bully draco who gets into an argument with rons father when he insults the weasley family as harry prepares to return to hogwarts he finds that he and ron are unable to go through the secret entrance to platform so they fly the weasleys car to hogwarts they land messily and both boys are detained for obvious reasons next day molly weasley sends a howler to ron a letter that berates him with her much louder voice and threatens to send him home if he gets into trouble again lockhart quickly proves to be an incompetent teacher more concerned with students learning about his personal accomplishments on halloween something petrifies the school caretakers cat and writes a message declaring that the chamber of secrets has been opened before the cat is attacked harry twice hears an eerie voice he hears it first during his detention and second during a party moments before the cat is attacked and third before a quidditch match everybody in the school is alarmed harry ron and their other friend hermione granger learn that during the founding of hogwarts one of the founders salazar slytherin left the school disagreeing with the decision to teach magic to muggle born students according to legend slytherin secretly built the chamber of secrets which supposedly houses a monster only slytherins heir can control suspecting that draco is the heir of slytherin the trio start making polyjuice potion a brew which allows them to take on anothers form during the schools first game of quidditch harry is pursued continually by a bludger an enchanted ball that knocks players off their brooms despite their purpose being to unseat as many players as possible as a result harrys arm is broken and lockhart then proceeds to unintentionally remove the broken bones that night as he recovers from the injury harry is visited by dobby who admits to having orchestrated the platform incident and the rogue bludger both of which were attempts to keep harry away from hogwarts soon after a first year student colin creevy is attacked and petrified lockhart begins a dueling club and during the first meeting harry unknowingly speaks parseltongue to persuade a snake from attacking a student harrys ability frightens the others because salazar slytherin was also able to speak parseltongue and his heir would also have this ability harry comes under further suspicion when he stumbles upon the petrified bodies of justin finch fletchley and nearly headless nick at christmas harry and ron use the finished polyjuice potion to disguise themselves as dracos friends crabbe for ron and goyle for harry hermione was going to be millicent bulstrode another slytherin student but was instead given some features of a cat so does not joins them harry and ron find out that draco is not the heir of slytherin but he does reveal that the chamber was opened before no more attacks occur for a while and right before valentines day harry finds a diary in a flooded bathroom and takes it he writes in the diary which responds by writing back through this dialogue harry meets tom riddle a boy who many years before had accused hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper of first opening the chamber of secrets some time later harrys room is ransacked and the diary is taken later on hermione and a ravenclaw girl penolope clearwater are petrified harry and ron venture out of the castle to question hagrid before they can question him however the minister of magic cornelius fudge takes hagrid to azkaban as the supposed previous culprit while at the same time lucius malfoy orchestrates the removal of hogwarts headmaster albus dumbledore for his failure to stop the attacks as hagrid is led away he instructs the boys to follow the spiders as they will be able to provide more information harry and ron then sneak into the forbidden forest to follow the spiders they encounter aragog who reveals the monster who killed the girl fifty years before was not a spider that the girls body was found in a bathroom and that hagrid is innocent the boys are almost eaten by the colony of giant spiders after they escape harry and ron realize that moaning myrtle the ghost who haunts the bathroom where they made the polyjuice potion must have been the girl killed by the monster a few days later ron and harry discover a piece of paper with a description of a basilisk a giant serpent that kills all who look it directly in the eye in hermiones petrified hand they deduce that the chambers monster is indeed a basilisk since as a snake harry can understand what it was saying when it travelled through the schools pipes as for the petrifications these were due to the victims looking at the basilisks eyes indirectly before the boys can act on their knowledge the teachers announce that rons sister ginny weasley has been taken into the chamber lockhart arrives and is pressured by the other teachers into venturing into the chamber and dealing with the monster unknown to them and to him harry and ron go to give him their information only to discover that he is a fraud regardless they force him to accompany them to the chamber the trio discovers that the entrance to the chamber is in myrtles bathroom and harrys parseltongue is able to open it inside the chamber lockhart steals rons wand and attempts to wipe the memories of the other two in order to keep his secrets safe however rons wand which has been broken since the car crash at the start of the year deflects the spell back at lockhart wiping his memory a cave in then separates him and ron from harry who is forced to proceed alone harry finds ginnys unconscious body as well as the almost physical form of riddle riddle explains that ginny has been talking with him via his diary through this riddle was able to possess ginny and use her to control the basilisk ginny eventually became suspicious of the diary and tried to dispose of it in a toilet where it was picked up by harry but stole it back for fear harry would find out her role in the attacks riddle forced her to enter the chamber and possessing her soul was able to obtain a physical form riddle reveals that tom marvolo riddle is an anagram although it is his real name for i am lord voldemort who is the wizard who murdered harrys parents eleven years ago and sets the basilisk on harry just when it seems harry will be killed by the basilisk fawkes dumbledores pet phoenix appears and blinds the basilisk depriving it of its deadly stare fawkes also drops the school sorting hat from which harry draws a sword and uses it to kill the basilisk as he does so one of the basilisks fangs pierce harrys arm and harry is saved by fawkes as phoenix tears have immense healing powers harry then stabs the diary with a basilisk fang defeating riddle and saving ginny the five of them later leave the chamber back at hogwarts they discover that dumbledore has been reinstated as headmaster after harry finishes explaining things to dumbledore lucius malfoy suddenly bursts in to dumbledores office it is implied that he had planted riddles diary on ginny in the first place in the hopes of discrediting dumbledore and the weasleys discovering that mr malfoy is dobbys master harry then tricks him into freeing dobby by concealing a sock in the diary clothing being the only object able to free a house elf all the petrified people are revived by a mandrake draught potion lockhart is sent to the wizarding hospital where he tries to regain his memories and hagrid returns to the school

The Handmaid's Tale,Margaret Atwood,the handmaids tale is set in the near future in the republic of gilead a country formed within the borders of what was formerly the united states of america it was founded by a racist homophobic christian nativist theocratic organized military coup as an ideologically driven response to the pervasive ecological physical and social degradation of the country beginning with a staged terrorist attack blamed on islamic extremist terrorists that kills the president and most of congress a movement calling itself the sons of jacob launches a revolution and suspends the united states constitution under the pretext of restoring order taking advantage of electronic banking they were quickly able to freeze the assets of all women and other undesirables in the country stripping them of their rights the new theocratic military dictatorship styled the republic of gilead moved quickly to consolidate its power and reorganize society along a new militarized hierarchical compulsorily christian regime of old testament inspired social and religious orthodoxy among its newly created social classes in this society almost all women are forbidden to read the story is presented from the point of view of a woman called offred literally of fred however not a patronymic as some critics claim the character is one of a class of individuals kept as concubines handmaids for reproductive purposes by the ruling class in an era of declining births the book is told in the first person by offred who describes her life during her third assignment as a handmaid in this case to fred referred to as the commander if offred fails to become pregnant on this her third attempt she will be declared an unwoman and discarded interspersed in flashbacks are portions of her life from before and during the beginning of the revolution when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband through her failed attempt to escape with her husband and daughter to canada to her indoctrination into life as a handmaid through her eyes the structure of gileads society is described including the several different categories of women and their circumscribed lives in the new theocracy the commander is a high ranking official in gilead although he is only supposed to have sexual intercourse with offred during the period called the ceremony a ritual at which his wife is present he begins an illegal and ambiguous relationship with her exposing offred to many hidden or contraband aspects of the new society such as fashion magazines and cosmetics he takes her to a secret brothel run by the government and he furtively meets with her in his study where he allows her the contraband activity of reading the commanders wife also had secret interactions with offred she arranges for offred to secretly have sex with her driver nick in an effort to get her pregnant the commanders wife believes the commander to be sterile a subversive belief as official gilead policy is that only women can be sterile in exchange for offreds cooperation the commanders wife gives her news of her daughter whom offred has not seen since she and her family were captured trying to escape gilead after offreds initial meeting with nick they begin to rendezvous more frequently offred finds herself enjoying sex with nick despite her indoctrination and her memories of her husband and even goes as far as to divulge potentially dangerous information about her past through another handmaid ofglen offred learns of the mayday resistance an underground network with the intent of overthrowing gilead shortly after ofglens disappearance later discovered to be a suicide the commanders wife finds evidence of the relationship between offred and the commander and offred contemplates suicide as the novel concludes she is being taken away by men from the secret police known as the eyes in a large black van under orders from nick before she is taken away nick tells her that the men are part of the mayday resistance and that offred must trust him offred does not know if nick is truly a member of the mayday resistance or if he is a government agent posing as one and she does not know if going with the men will result in her escape or her capture she enters the van with a final thought on her uncertain future the novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that explains that the events of the novel occurred shortly after the beginning of what is called the gilead period the epilogue itself is a transcription of a symposium on gileadean studies written some time in the

Jingo,Terry Pratchett,with the opening of the novel the island of leshp which had been submerged under the circle sea for centuries rises to the surface its position exactly halfway between ankh morpork and al khali the capital of klatch makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it which both cities do in ankh morpork a klatchian prince named khufurah is parading through ankh morpork where he will be presented with a degree in sweet fanny adams doctorum adamus cum flabello dulci but an assassination attempt occurs and the prince is wounded sir samuel vimes commander of the ankh morpork city watch begins investigating the crime originally suspecting both a klatchian named hour ahmed and a senior morporkian peer lord rust of being involved the attempted assassination breaks off relations between ankh morpork and klatch as prince khufurahs brother effectively declares war on the city of ankh morpork at this point havelock vetinari patrician of ankh morpork resigns apparently of his own free will and lord rust takes command of the city vetinari has refused to become involved in the war with klatch due to the fact ankh morpork does not have an army to stand against any opposing forces the reason given being that killing enemy soldiers makes it difficult to sell them things afterwards but rust declares martial law and orders the citys noble families to revive their old private regiments vimes refusing to follow rust whom he considers to be a pillock stands down as commander of the watch captain carrot resigns as well as do sergeant colon sergeant detritus and corporal angua the idea of putting the watch under the command of corporal nobbs is rejected by the ruling council of guild leaders and the watch is disbanded vimes then recruits the watch into his own private army regiment reasoning that as an official noble he is entitled to do so by law and by lord rusts command with the group remaining independent as knights legally fall under command of the king or his duly appointed representatives neither of which exist in ankh morpork angua following hour ahmed is captured by the klatchians and taken to klatch carrot rather than rush off to save her reports back to vimes who gets his private army to head for klatch meanwhile nobby and sergeant colon have been recruited by vetinari and his pet inventor leonard of quirm on a secret mission of their own unknown to vimes vetinari leonard of quirm colon and nobby end up in leonards going under the water safely device and discover that leshp is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas suggested to be methane or some other poisonous gas and that the gas is escaping from said bubble meaning that leshp will ultimately sink back under the sea again vimes catches up with hour ahmed and has by this time figured out that ahmed is a fellow policeman ahmed and his band of klatchian dregs and vimes army head towards gebra in klatch where the war is due to start to help blend in vetinari nobby and fred colon get hold of some klatchian clothing though nobby ends up wearing the costume of a dancing girl and gets in touch with his feminine side the three also head to gebra arriving at gebra they discover that carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football he has an inflatable football in his backpack for just such an emergency vimes is preparing to arrest the klatchian prince and lord rust for various breaches of the peace such as being prepared for war and hour ahmed is supporting him vetinari prevents an international incident by ostensibly declaring the surrender of ankh morpork and offering war reparations vetinari is returned to ankh morpork under arrest and in disgrace but as leshp has vanished back under the sea again the treaty was to be signed in a non existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid sam vimes is informed that vetinari has been reminded that the old rank of commander was the same as the old rank of duke he objects claiming that only a king can make a duke but then realises that carrot was speaking to vetinari since carrot is of course very much not the king of ankh morpork his reminding of vetinari is all that is required for vimes to get his new position and rank vimes accidentally loses his dis organiser given to him by his wife which kept giving him incorrect information it is explained that had vimes reacted slightly differently in the beginning staying in ankh morpork rather than attempting to follow ahmed and rescue angua the whole history of the ankh morpork vs klatch war would have gone very differently the dis organiser meets death at the end but death rejects it instead he drops it into the sea and it is swallowed by a shark where it may not have the most interesting calendar of events to deal with but at least it finds things easy to organise

children to save himself he cannot persuade them to accompany him obstinate and pliable go after christian to bring him back but christian refuses obstinate returns disgusted but pliable is persuaded to go with christian hoping to take advantage of the paradise that christian claims lies at the end of his journey pliables journey with christian is cut short when the two of them fall into the slough of despond it is there that pliable abandons christian after getting himself out after struggling to the other side of the bog christian is pulled out by help who has heard his cries on his way to the wicket gate christian is diverted by mr worldly wiseman into seeking deliverance from his burden through the law supposedly with the help of a mr legality and his son civility in the village of

and threatens to crush any who would pass it evangelist shows christian that he had sinned by turning out of his way but he assures him that he will be welcomed at the wicket gate if he should turn around and go there which christian does at the wicket gate begins the straight and narrow kings highway and christian is directed onto it by the gatekeeper good will in the second part good will is shown to be jesus himself to christians query about relief from his burden good will directs him forward to the place of deliverance christian makes his way from there to the house of the interpreter where he is shown pictures and tableaux that portray or dramatize aspects of the christian faith and life roger sharrock denotes them emblems from the house of the interpreter christian finally

sepulchre this event happens relatively early in the narrative the immediate need of christian at the beginning of the story being quickly remedied after christian is relieved of his burden he is greeted by three shining ones who give him the greeting of peace new garments and a scroll as a passport into the celestial city these are allegorical figures indicative of christian baptism atop the hill of difficulty christian makes his first stop for the night at the house beautiful which is an allegory of the local christian congregation christian spends three days here and leaves clothed with armour eph which stands him in good stead in his battle against apollyon in the valley of humiliation this battle lasts over half a day until christian manages to wound apollyon with his two edged sword a reference to the bible heb and with that apollyon spread his dragon wings and sped away as night falls christian enters the valley of the shadow of death when he is in the middle of the valley amidst the gloom and terror he hears the words of the twenty third psalm spoken possibly by his friend faithful yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me psalm as he leaves this valley the sun rises on a new day just outside the valley of the shadow of death he meets faithful also a former resident of the city of destruction who accompanies him to vanity fair where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the fair faithful is put on trial and executed as a martyr hopeful a resident of vanity takes faithful s place to be christian s companion for the rest of the way along a rough stretch of road christian and hopeful leave the highway to travel on the easier by path meadow where a rainstorm forces them to spend the night in the morning they are captured by giant despair who takes them to his doubting castle where they are imprisoned beaten and starved the giant wants them to commit suicide but they endure the ordeal until christian realizes that a key he has called promise will open all the doors and gates of doubting castle using the key they escape the delectable mountains form the next stage of christian and hopeful s journey where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as immanuel s land as at the house of the interpreter pilgrims are shown sights that strengthen their faith and warn them against sinning on mount clear they are able to see the celestial city through the shepherd s perspective glass which serves as a telescope this device is given to mercy in the second part at her request on the way christian and hopeful meet a lad named ignorance who believes that he will be allowed into the celestial city through his own good deeds rather than as a gift of god s grace christian and hopeful meet up with him twice and try to persuade him to journey to the celestial city in the right way ignorance persists in his own way that leads to his being cast into hell after getting over the river of death on the ferry boat of vain hope without overcoming the hazards of wading across it ignorance appears before the gates of celestial city without a passport which he would have acquired had he gone into the king s highway through the wicket gate the lord of the celestial city orders shining ones to take ignorance to one of the byways to hell and throw him in christian and hopeful make it through the dangerous enchanted ground into the land of beulah where they ready themselves to cross the river of death on foot to mount zion and the celestial city christian has a rough time of it but hopeful helps him over and they are welcomed into the celestial city the second part of the pilgrims progress presents the pilgrimage of christian s wife christiana their sons and the maiden mercy they visit the same stopping places that christian visited with the addition of gaius inn between the valley of the shadow of death and vanity fair but they take a longer time in order to accommodate marriage and childbirth for the four sons and their wives the hero of the story is greatheart the servant of the interpreter who is a pilgrim s guide to the celestial city he kills four giants and participates in the slaying of a monster that terrorizes the city of vanity the passage of years in this second pilgrimage better allegorizes the journey of the christian life by using heroines bunyan in the second part illustrates the idea that women as well as men can be brave pilgrims alexander m witherspoon professor of english at yale university writes in a prefatory essay part ii which appeared in is much more than a mere sequel to or repetition of the earlier volume it clarifies and reinforces and justifies the story of part i the beam of bunyans spotlight is broadened to include christians family and other men women and children the incidents and accidents of everyday life are more numerous the joys of the pilgrimage tend to outweigh the hardships and to the faith and hope of part i is added in abundant measure that greatest of virtues charity the two parts of the pilgrims progress in reality constitute a whole and the whole is without doubt the most influential religious book ever written in the english language this is exemplified by the frailness of the pilgrims of the second part in contrast to those of the first women children and physically and mentally challenged individuals when christiana s party leaves gaius s inn and mr feeble mind lingers in order to be left behind he is encouraged to accompany the party by greatheart but brother i have it in commission to comfort the feeble minded and to support the weak you must needs go along with us we will wait for you we will lend you our help we will deny ourselves of some things both opinionative and practical for your sake we will not enter into doubtful disputations before you we will be made all things to you rather than you shall be left behind when the pilgrims end up in the land of beulah they cross over the river of death by appointment as a matter of importance to christians of bunyan s persuasion reflected in the narrative of the pilgrims progress the last words of the pilgrims as they cross over the river are recorded the four sons of christian and their families do not cross but remain for the support of the church in that place

The Anatomy of Melancholy,Robert Burton,burton defined his subject as follows in attacking his stated subject burton drew from nearly every science of his day including psychology and physiology but also astronomy meteorology and theology and even astrology and demonology much of the book consists of quotations from various ancient and medi val medical authorities beginning with hippocrates aristotle and galen hence the anatomy is filled with more or less pertinent references to the works of others a competent latinist burton also included a great deal of latin poetry in the anatomy and many of his inclusions from ancient sources are left untranslated in the text the anatomy of melancholy is an especially lengthy book the first edition being a single quarto volume nearly pages long subsequent editions were even longer the text is divided into three major sections plus an introduction the whole written in burtons sprawling style characteristically the introduction includes not only an authors note titled democritus junior to the reader but also a latin poem democritus junior to his book a warning to the reader who employs his leisure ill an abstract of the following text and another poem explaining the frontispiece the following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of common melancholies while the second section deals with cures for melancholy and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies including the melancholy of lovers and all varieties of religious melancholies the anatomy concludes with an extensive index which many years later the new york times book review called a readerly pleasure in itself most modern editions include many explanatory notes and translate most of the latin
Red Storm Rising,Tom Clancy,islamic terrorists from azerbaijan destroy a soviet oil production facility at nizhnevartovsk russia crippling the ussrs oil production and threatening to wreck the nations economy contemplating concessions to the west to survive the crisis the politburo instead decides to seize the oil fields in the persian gulf by military force according to the carter doctrine any attack on the gulf is an attack on strategic interests to the united states necessitating a military response to prevent a combined reaction by nato the soviets launch a kgb operation to carry out a false flag operation framing west germany for an unprovoked attack on the ussr afterwards the soviets plan to invade europe in response to that attack with west germany occupied and nato defeated the soviets hope that the u s will not rescue the arab oil states when it attacks them as it can meet its oil needs with western sources the politburo arranges a bomb blast in the kremlin that kills some visiting schoolchildren blaming a west german exile for the attack the kgb operation has limited success the planned attack on west germany is detected when a spetsnaz major is captured in aachen the officers capture gives nato time to mobilize its forces and preserve the alliance nonetheless the operation scores some success as several governments notably those of greece and japan publicly claim that this german russian disagreement does not warrant involvement thus the soviets face no opposition in either the pacific theater or the mediterranean region nato aircraft manage to sharply reduce soviet ground superiority on the first night of the war by using first generation stealth planes and tactical fighter bombers to eliminate soviet mainstay awacs aircraft and tactical fighters the nato forces achieve air superiority and destroy many key bridges over which much of the soviet army had yet to cross the soviets advance at great cost having dramatically underestimated nato defensive firepower germany becomes the epicentre of the conflict here nato forces are slowly driven west while inflicting significant damage to the encroaching soviet army simultaneously the soviets seize iceland in a covert surprise attack capturing the nato air station at keflav k and disrupting the giuk sosus line to allow the soviet navy to operate in the atlantic ocean undetected in addition the soviet navy takes steps to protect its ballistic missile submarine fleet in costal waters behind minefields and asw assets allowing the full use of its attack submarines to engage and destroy nato shipping rather than escorting strategic assets in essence the soviet navy is able to act as an offensive weapon contrary to pre war nato expectations becoming a major strategic threat against resupply convoys coming from north america with both aircraft and submarines this advantage is put to immediate use as a nato carrier battle group led by uss nimitz uss saratoga and the french carrier foch is successfully attacked by soviet badger and backfire bombers the latter firing kingfish missiles the soviets use kelt missiles as decoys set to transmit as if they were backfires on the predicted attack vector far out from the main air fleet the american carriers f interceptors are committed against the decoys leaving an insufficient number of crusaders from the foch and the ships surface to air missiles to defend against the bombers approaching from another direction foch is sunk the amphibious assault carrier saipan explodes taking marines with her and the two american carriers are forced to spend several weeks in drydock at southampton england in west germany the battle becomes a war of attrition that the soviets expect to win through slow and sustained advances with the death of the soviet political favorite cinc west in a nato air attack on the soviet rear lines the more competent cinc southwest and his second in command general colonel pavel leonidovich alekseyev take over on the german front alekseyev commands a successful soviet attack on the town of alfeld finally giving the soviet army the breakthrough it needs as the omg operational manoeuvre group forces start to deploy nato looks likely to lose all of germany east of the weser river when a brilliantly timed naval attack on soviet bomber bases with submarine launched cruise missiles cripples the soviet bomber force the soviets lose their most effective convoy and fleet killing weapon the u s marines take this opportunity to stage an amphibious assault on iceland backed by nato navies retaking the island and closing the atlantic to soviet forces a failed bomber raid on the nato naval forces attacking iceland in which the remaining soviet naval cruise missile bomber fleets are nearly wiped out essentially means victory in the atlantic opening the ussr to direct attacks from carrier strike groups against its northern strategic areas and the free flow of convoys across the atlantic simultaneously with the sudden reversal in the atlantic saceur a renowned poker player makes an audacious gamble in the face of a final soviet offensive that pushes nato ground forces to the breaking point launching an unexpected flanking manoeuvre that places heavy nato forces in the rear of the soviet spearhead cutting their last frontline units off behind two different rivers and interdicting their supplies intelligence gained from a prisoner on iceland finally reveals the dire fuel situation in the ussr to nato who promptly switch bombing tactics and wipe out significant forward fuel depots essentially immobilising the last of the elite soviet formations with the soviet advance decisively halted nato catches its breath and prepares to move into a general offensive against the increasingly ineffective soviet c category reserves being moved forward with the conventional situation in europe turning against them and their strategic situation increasingly bleak due to the drawdown on national oil reserves resulting in a crippled economy the politburo are moved to consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons at the front to regain the initiative alekseyev realizing that a tactical nuclear exchange would almost certainly lead to a strategic nuclear exchange seeks and obtains control of his theatres nuclear weapons as part of their planning ostensibly for practical matters of tactical targeting but in reality to ensure they are never used in the face of this nightmare scenario general alekseyev joins forces with the chairman of the kgb and the energy minister mikhail eduardovich sergetov in staging a coup d tat replacing the politburo with a troika consisting of sergetov agriculture minister f m krylov and longtime politburo member pyotr bromkovskiy an elderly and respected world war ii veteran whilst the chairman of the kgb is allowed to be executed by a major revealed to be a parent of one of the children who was killed in the kremlin bombing with the government back under control alekseyev flies back to germany and personally negotiates with saceur to bring an end to the war forestalling the launching of natos counter

black george allworthys gamekeeper but he refuses to tell mr allworthy who his partner in crime was he is beaten by his master mr thwackum who resides at the house with another schoolmaster a

young boy tom tries to retrieve it but in doing so falls into a canal this incident turns sophia against blifil but puts tom in her favour tom speaks to sophia about george and she persuades her father to drop any charges and to employ him sophia is falling for tom but his heart is given over to molly the second of black georges daughters and a local beauty she throws herself at tom and he

requests her father to ask her to be her maid but the family council decides to put everything on hold until toms intentions become clearer squire western the local parson tom and sophia are having dinner when the parson informs western of mollys condition at which tom leaves the dining table squire western immediately jumps to the conclusion that tom is the father of the bastard much to sophias consternation tom returns to his home to find molly in the arms of a constable and being taken to prison he bids him free her and they go to speak to mr allworthy where tom reveals he is the father saying the guilt is his however mr allworthy is ultimately forgiving of toms sowing his wild oats while he was angry therefore with the incontinence of jones he was no less pleased with the honour and honesty of his self accusation he began now to form in his mind the same opinion of this young fellow which we hope our reader may have conceived and in balancing his faults and his perfections the latter seemed rather to preponderate an incident now occurs in which tom comes to the aid of sophia she goes out hunting with her father and on her way home is thrown by her horse tom who is riding close behind is able to catch her but breaks his left arm in the process the accident brings them closer and there is the first stirring of love tom is seen by a surgeon and ordered into bed and sophia is bled at her fathers orders book iv concludes with a conversation between sophia and mrs honour her maid who is extolling toms virtues to the former and sophia becomes annoyed by her presumptuousness tom thinks about his love for sophia but knows that her father would not agree to any union so his thoughts turn back to molly who he believes is in all the circumstances of wretchedness tom once he is recovered makes his way to mollys home only to discover her in bed with his teacher square tom still feels some affection for her until he is told by betty mollys older sister that her innocence had been taken before tom by will barnes a country gallant in the meantime mr allworthy has become ill and is told by his doctor that it may be fatal he summons all his relatives and household servants to his bedside and informs them of his will blifil will inherit the estate and tom will be given a lump sum and per annum thwackum and square will get a each and the household servants some token payments which displeases mrs wilkins the housekeeper however allworthy recovers and tom is so pleased that he gets drunk in his pleasure which displeases blifil who is in mourning after receiving news that his mother has died a scuffle ensues but the two are parted and made to make peace with each other after this fight tom still drunk is wandering the gardens thinking about sophia when molly makes an appearance after a quarter of an hours conversation the two disappear into the bushes blifil and thwackum likewise take an evening stroll and blifil spots tom with a woman he informs thwackum who becomes furious and is determined to punish tom tom guards the entrance to the shrubbery to prevent them seeing who the girl is and while molly escapes a fight ensues which tom starts to lose until squire western intervenes to make it two against two sophia faints at the sight of all the blood and tom carries her to a nearby brook giving her a caress which she does not spurn sophia recovers much to her fathers delight tom returns to westerns house and blifil and thwackum to theirs miss western is the cultured sister of squire western and sophias aunt although unmarried herself she recognises the signs of love and notices that sophia is showing these she informs her brother that his daughter is in love with blifil miss western had noted sophias behaviour in his presence and squire western informs allworthy when he visits for dinner allworthy says he will give his approval if the young couple agree and consults blifil who thinking of sophias fortune agrees to his uncles request no one knows of sophias love for tom miss western then speaks to sophia to reveal her amour and is enraged when she finds out it is not blifil but tom with her aunt agreeing to keep the whole thing a secret mr western tells sophia about his intentions and she is obliged to meet blifil that afternoon sophia is determined to go through with the meeting even though she hates and despises blifil after a difficult meeting in which blifil thinks he has won her heart he is accosted by squire western before he leaves and blifil announces that he is satisfied with sophia much to the fathers delight however once he is gone sophia reveals her true feelings for blifil but he ignores her pleadings and grows enraged tom is in the house and is asked by western to go to sophia to encourage her to marry blifil the two young lovers are in agony and reveal they can never part from each other as they take each others hands however whilst they have been conversing miss western has revealed all to the squire who threatens to assault jones but is only prevented from doing so by the parson mr western then visits his neighbour allworthy and informs him of the situation in heated tones after his departure mr allworthy asks blifil if he still wants to proceed with the marriage and the latter replies in the affirmative mainly to spite tom blifil also takes the opportunity to inform his uncle about the bust up in the shrubbery saying that tom assaulted his tutor thwackum allworthy summons tom before him to plead his case but tom is sunk too low from hearing the news about sophia to make a robust defence as such he is commanded by his foster father to leave the house immediately after being given a sum of tom walks about a mile and thinking beside a little brook is resolved to quit sophia rather than bring her to ruin he pens a letter from a neighbouring house but discovers in searching his pockets for his wax that he has lost his wallet and returns to the brook to look for it here he meets george and together they look for it although george has already picked it up on coming to the same spot earlier tom asks him to deliver his letter for sophia to mrs honour and on doing so george receives one back for tom in it sophia professes her affection for him but also warns him to steer clear of her father as you know his temper i beg you will for my sake avoid him sophia is locked up in her room by her father but honour manages to give her toms letter she also tells her that the squire stripped him half naked and turned him out of doors sophia gives her all the money she has amounting to a purse of sixteen guineas telling her to give it to tom honour gives the money to black george who is tempted to steal it like the earlier but the danger of the theft being discovered outweighs his greed and he delivers the money to jones the book ends with the return of miss western to the house and her being informed of sophias captivity she rebukes her brother and sets sophia free tom receives a note from blifil along with his effects informing him that his uncle requires him to immediately quit the neighbourhood sophia speaks to her aunt who tries to persuade her of the advantages of marrying blifil however mr western overhears their conversation and storms into the room he and his sister get into a furious argument over his behaviour and she threatens to quit the house however on the sound advice of sophia she is recalled by mr western who makes efforts to pacify her having become reconciled both are determined to have sophia married as quickly as possible and blifil makes a second visit mr allworthy is satisfied by what his nephew and western tell him concerning sophia and the marriage treaty is set two days hence sophia is now fixed on avoiding the marriage and in a conversation with honour says she will quit the house and stay with a lady of quality in london who is her close acquaintance honour agrees to accompany her and agrees to get herself discharged so that their clothes can be packed for the journey without any undue suspicion honour deliberately provokes the chambermaid of miss western by abusing her mistress and the lady herself is told of their conversation and vows to have honour discharged for her impudence there follows a dispute between mr western and his sister over the legality of dismissing honour but in the end the latter has the satisfaction of seeing honour turned away sophia is conscience stricken about her infidelity to her relations but her love for tom prevails tom is on the road to bristol being determined to take to sea however his guide gets lost and they take shelter at a public house on the advice of a quaker the quaker gets into a conversation with tom even though the latter wants to be alone telling him about his own misfortune of having his daughter run off with a penniless man of low birth vowing he will never see them again and tom pushes him out of the room a company of soldiers enter the ale house as tom is sleeping on a chair and getting into a dispute over who will pay for the beer tom agrees to cover the bill he strikes up a conversation with the sergeant who tells him they are marching against the roman catholic rebels who had invaded england expecting to be commanded by the glorious duke of cumberland tom being a hearty well wisher to the glorious cause of liberty and of the protestant religion agrees to join them as a volunteer the soldiers march off and that evening tom is introduced to the lieutenant a man who is sixty years of age looking like a gentleman he is invited to dinner with the small company of officers tom gets into an argument with ensign northerton who then proceeds to abuse the good name of sophia after tom has proposed a toast to her tom rebukes him saying you are one of the most impudent scoundrels on earth and northerton responds by throwing a bottle at toms head which poleaxes him the lieutenant proceeds to put northerton under close arrest and a surgeon is called to stem the bleeding tom is put to bed and the lieutenant visits him promising he will get his satisfaction against his adversary later that night tom who is feeling much better wakes the sergeant and purchases a sword from him before making his way to northertons room he is shot at by the guard who thinks he is a ghost his coat is bloodied as is the bandage around his head and then faints however the bird has flown with the connivance of the landlady and tom returns to his room whilst the lieutenant has the sentinel put under arrest tom tells the lieutenant that he is to blame for the disturbance and the latter agrees to drop the charge against the soldier the landlady visits tom after the soldiers have left and is courteous to him until he shows her his purse which has very little in it he then dismisses the doctor who insists on bleeding him so he can get a decent fee and finally is able to get up and dressed he calls for a barber to shave him after a dinner of buttock beef and carrot and little benjamin turns out to be mr partridge the schoolmaster tom reveals his whole story to him and partridge agrees to accompany him on his journey secretly hoping that he can convince tom to return to allworthy whom he is convinced is toms real father so that he can get back into allworthys favour once more they make their way on foot to gloucester and stay at the bell however there is a pettifogger a lawyer of low status who engages in mean practices present who besmirches toms name to the landlady mrs whitefield after tom has left their company with toms name now mud the landladys welcome grows cold and he is resolved to quit the house the same evening they make their way on foot on a freezing night toward some hills that they have been informed lie not far from worcester tom begs his companion to leave him telling him he is resolved to die a glorious death in the service of my king and country but the latter refuses to leave him partridge eventually sees the glimmer of a light and they make their way to an isolated house whilst warming themselves by the fire and conversing with the housekeeper the owner returns and is set upon by two robbers tom rushes outside with a broadsword and drives them off and helps the old gentleman into the house this gentleman called the man of the hill then recounts his life story to tom and partridge a prudent and industrious student he fell into bad company at oxford and had to flee to london with his mistress to escape being expelled

london to look for him and has been assaulted by thieves they are re united by chance as the son who is walking down the same street comes to his fathers aid after the affray he returns with his father to somersetshire and spends the next four years in contemplation of the works of aristotle and plato and of god his father dies and he being the younger son finds it difficult to live with his brother who lives entirely for sport he is sent to bath by his physician to take the waters and manages to save a man from committing suicide by drowning the very same watson his friend from london both are then caught up in bonnie prince charlies rebellion and when captured the stranger tells tom and partridge that he was denounced by watson however he manages to escape his captors and ends up living at the present house on an annuity an exile from the world of humanity the book ends with the old man and tom taking a walk together to enjoy the sight of some fine prospects in the early hours of the day whilst observing the view they hear a woman screaming and tom rushes down the hill to help he comes upon a woman half naked being throttled by a man whom tom knocks down it is ensign northerton tom restrains his hands with a garter and goes back to the man of the hill for advice tom is told to take her to upton the nearest town when tom returns to the woman northerton has made his escape on foot and tom and the lady make their way to the town on the way tom is sneaking peeps at her uncovered breasts at which he has gazed earlier they eventually find an inn and tom instructs the lady to wait whilst he fetches her some clothes the landlady and landlord think that something immoral is taking place and assault tom who is only saved from a beating by the arrival of partridge susan the hefty chambermaid joins in and it is only the arrival of a young lady and maid that ends the battle a sergeant arrives with his men and recognises the woman to be mrs waters his captains wife and the inns hosts make their apologies and peace is restored around a bowl of liquor mrs waters then retires with tom upstairs and proceeds to make a pass at him finding her savior extremely attractive they end up in bed together in the meantime an argument takes place downstairs when the landlord abuses officers of rank in the army the sergeant takes offense and offers to fight the best man of you all for twenty pound and the coachman of the young lady takes him on saying he is as good as any man in the army and offers to box for a guinea he is well mauled by the sergeant and so unable to convey the young lady on her journey an account is then given of how mrs waters ended up in the distressful situation from which jones rescued her her husband having accompanied her as far as worcester had proceeded onwards and northerton had joined her for an assignation he tells her of the incident with jones and they decide to make for hereford then a welsh seaport so that he can make his escape abroad mrs waters has and her jewelry to finance their journey however it was in the wood at the foot of mazard hill that northerton tried to kill her but she being not of the weakest

goes back upstairs and sophia decides to leave her muff with her name written on it for tom to let him know she was there and departs tom finds the muff and determines to give chase to sophia western now arrives with some of his followers at the inn the narrator mentions here that if he had come two hours earlier he would not only have found sophia but also his niece for such was the wife of mr

recounts her story to sophia she met fitzpatrick whilst staying with her aunt mrs western in bath he paid court to her aunt but was also very kind to herself until he eventually professed his love for her the aunt left bath and she married fitzpatrick however he says they will have to return to his estate in ireland which she is very reluctant to do and by accident finds a debtors letter from his tailor in which he recalls fitzpatrick saying he would soon marry either the aunt or the niece which would settle his debts preferring the niece as he would have quicker access to the money harriet reveals all to her husband but he fobs her off and they travel to ireland his house is very dismal and he proves the opposite of the gallant in bath he is aggressive and boorish in his behaviour to her eventually he imprisons her in her bedroom but whilst on a three month trip to england she is able to make her escape with the help of a neighbouring aristocrat she intended to make for bath to plead with her aunt and this is how she ran into sophia there is also an interlude when mrs honour assaults the landlord when she finds out that he thinks sophia is jenny cameron it happens that the

intends to make for bath in order to have an alliance with the irish nobleman she makes her farewell repeating their aunts maxim to harriet that whenever the matrimonial alliance is broke and war

lady bellaston who promises she will do everything in her power to protect her squire western is in pursuit of his daughter but gets waylaid by a hunt and ends up returning home tom and partridge come across a lame fellow in rags to whom tom gives a shilling the beggar offers tom something he has found and it turns out to be sophias pocket book with the note tucked inside tom gives the man a guinea

she politely consents the book concludes with sophia attempting to ward off her cousins questions about the young gentleman lady bellaston pays a surprise visit to toms apartments however they are interrupted by the arrival of mrs honour bearing a letter for tom from sophia and lady bellaston is forced to hide behind a curtain honour assures tom of her mistress regard and after she has left lady bellaston emerges from her place of concealment as streams of fire darted from her eyes and well indeed they might for her heart was all in a flame however tom makes his peace with her and they agree that future visits to her house will appear as though they are for sophias sake bellaston being convinced that sophia possessed the first place in joness affections and she submitted at last to bear the second place mrs miller talks to tom about the house getting a reputation of one of ill fame tom assures her that he will change his place of lodgings nightingale tells him that he too has resolved to quit the house although tom reminds him that nancy the eldest daughter is in love with him but nightingale is not unduly concerned liking to boast about his skill at gaining women much to toms dismay nightingale however quits the house and mrs miller is distraught revealing to tom that nancy is with child by him all he has left her is a note stating that he cannot marry her as his father has insisted on his paying his addresses to a young lady of fortune whom he has chosen for him as a wife jones promises to go and talk to nightingale and attempts to persuade him to change his mind during the conversation he resolves to speak to nightingales father and inform him that nightingale is already married to ms miller a proposal to which the son readily assents a farcical conversation takes place in a coffee house with tom speaking about nancy miller whereas the father presumes he is talking about miss harris and tom saying he is already married old mr nightingales brother then makes an appearance and also helps to persuade his brother against a union with miss harris for as he is her neighbour he knows her to be very tall very thin very ugly very affected very silly and very ill natured jones finally agrees to conduct the uncle to his nephew in mrs millers house mrs miller informs jones that all matters are settled between nightingale and nancy and that they are to be married the next day the uncle however takes his nephew upstairs and on finding out that he is not married tells him to call off the wedding as it is both foolish and preposterous they return downstairs and the others feel that something is amiss especially tom as the uncle departs with nightingale however tom receives a visit from mrs honour who informs him she has dreadful news regarding her mistress lady bellaston is now determined to get sophia out of the way the young nobleman who escorted sophia from the play lord fellamar approaches lady bellaston and declares his love for sophia and she says she will promote his cause with her father although pointing out that he has a rival for her affection a beggar a bastard a foundling a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your lordships own footmen she persuades an acquaintance tom edwards to announce in front of sophia that jones has been killed in a duel and sophia retires to her room in dismay bellaston and fellamar then hatch a plan for the latter to ravish sophia the next evening whilst the servants are out of the house and whilst lady bellaston is in an apartment distant from the scene despite having scruples fellamar falls in with her scheme and throws himself at sophia but the rape is interrupted by the arrival of squire western and his parson the lord believes the father will accept him as his future son in law but is brushed aside by western who removes sophia to his own lodgings lady bellaston is not too perturbed by the failure of her scheme with fellamar since at least sophia is now out of the way the plot now reverts back to how the squire discovered his daughters whereabouts mrs fitzpatrick hoping to reconcile her aunt and uncle sent a letter to mrs western informing them of sophias present location the lady passes the letter to her brother and he is resolved to go to london with his sister following a day later honour as mentioned earlier comes to see tom with the bad news whilst she is speaking to him lady bellastons arrival is announced and mrs honour this time is forced to hide lady bellaston comments on jones attractiveness but he cannot reply in kind as honour is present in the room however his embarrassment is ended when mr nightingale stumbles drunk into the room and lady bellaston is forced to share the hiding place with honour the lady after assuring the maid of her friendship in order to stop her repeating what she has heard takes her leave in a fury mrs honour also berates tom for his infidelity to her mistress but he eventually manages to calm her down nancy and nightingale are married at doctors commons and tom then receives three letters from lady bellaston requesting his presence at her home nightingale confronts tom and tells him about her reputation around town tom also reveals his deep love for sophia whom he now idolizes jones and nightingale his privy council proceed to hatch their own plan so that he can be rid of bellaston nightingale knows that she turned away a former young man when he proposed marriage to her and he suggests that tom does the same the latter is reluctant in case she agrees to his proposal but nightingale believes the young man in question angered by the ill offices she had done him since would show tom her letters the knowledge of which he could use to break off the affair tom writes a letter and lady bellaston writes back banishing him from her home mrs miller receives notice from mr allworthy that he is coming to london and tom mr and mrs nightingale remove to new apartments tom having dispatched mrs honour to give him more news about sophias state receives a letter from her saying she now has a position with lady bellaston and can tell him nothing a few days later mr partridge bumps into black george and over a few pots of beer learns that he is working for squire western and can convey letters to sophia in order to help tom tom sits down to write his epistle the scene shifts to squire westerns lodgings in piccadilly recommended by the landlord at the hercules pillars at hyde park corner where sophia is locked in her room an officer asks to be presented and informs the squire and parson he has come on behalf of lord fellamar who wants to visit his daughter on the footing of a lover but western throws him out sophia hearing the noise below her starts screaming and her father enters her room asking her to fulfill his demands but she once more refuses and her father storms out once more ignoring her pleas and tears however black george is able to slip sophia toms letter hidden inside a pullet and she muses over it mrs western now arrives and is highly indignant over sophias imprisonment she demands that she be given complete control over the niece and with the support of the parson the squire finally agrees and mrs western conducts her to her own more salubrious lodgings tom now receives a letter from sophia written from her aunts lodgings and begging him to give her up in order that he may be reconciled to mr allworthy and enclosing the banknote as she knows tom requires money the plot now switches back to the past when blifil was informed by western about his daughters flight to london blifils case that sophia loves him is now more uncertain allworthy agrees to blifils insistent demands that he accompany him to london but warns his nephew i will never give my consent to any absolute force being put on her inclinations nor shall you ever have her unless she can be brought freely of compliance once in london squire western and blifil barge into his sisters house and she is furious at the incivility of their entrance sophia who turns pale at the sight of blifil is allowed to retire to her room whilst her aunt castigates squire western for his rude country manners and at the same time suggests to blifil that perhaps he can visit sophia again in the afternoon blifil now quite rightly as the narrator points out suspects that mrs western may have turned against his cause lady bellaston sees lord fellamar and advises him to have jones somehow pressed and sent on board a ship she then meets mrs western they are cousins and the former tells the latter about lord fellamars attachment to sophia it is agreed they will pursue his case mrs western refers to blifil as a hideous kind of fellow with nothing but fortune to recommend him jones pays a visit to mrs fitzpatrick who encourages him to make a sham address to mrs western just as fitzpatrick did in order to win sophia but he outrightly declines the undertaking just as he does the advances now mrs fitzpatrick now makes towards him fitzpatrick has now come up to london from bath and sees jones coming out of his wifes house having suspicions about

inclinations of sophia towards blifil mr allworthy informs western that the marriage will not proceed mrs western now tries to persuade sophia to marry lord fellamar but she tells her aunt how he

The Fall,Albert Camus,the novel opens with clamence sitting in the bar mexico city casually talking to a stranger the reader some would say about the proper way to order a drink for here despite the cosmopolitan nature of amsterdam the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than dutch thus clamence serves as interpreter and he and the stranger having discovered that they are fellow compatriots who moreover both hail from paris begin discussing more substantive matters clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in paris as a highly successful and well respected defence lawyer the vast majority of his work centred around widow and orphan cases that is the poor and disenfranchised who otherwise would be unable to provide themselves with a proper defence before the law he also relates anecdotes about how he always enjoyed giving friendly directions to strangers on the streets yielding to others his seat on the bus giving alms to the poor and above all helping the blind to cross the street in short clamence conceived of himself as living purely for the sake of others and achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that supreme summit where virtue is its own reward camus however late one night when crossing the pont royal on his way home from his mistress clamence comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge he hesitates for a moment thinking the sight strange at such an hour and given the barrenness of the streets but continues on his way nevertheless he had only walked a short distance when he heard the distinct sound of a body hitting the water clamence stops walking knowing exactly what has happened but does nothing in fact he doesnt even turn around the sound of screaming was despite clamences view of himself as a selfless advocate for the weak and unfortunate he simply ignores the incident and continues on his way he later elaborates that his failure to do anything was most probably because doing so would have required him to put his own personal safety in jeopardy several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the pont royal and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work he pauses on the empty pont des arts and reflects clamence turns around to discover that the laughter of course was not directed at him but probably originated from a far off conversation between friends such is the rational course of his thought nevertheless he tells us that i could still hear it distinctly behind me coming from nowhere unless from the water the laughter is thus alarming because it immediately reminds him of his obvious failure to do anything whatsoever about the woman who had presumably drowned years before the unlucky coincidence for clamence here is that he is reminded of this precisely at the moment when he is congratulating himself for being such a selfless individual furthermore the laughter is described as a good hearty almost friendly laugh whereas mere moments later he describes himself as possessing a good hearty badger camus this implies that the laughter originated within himself adding another dimension to the inner meaning of the scene that evening on the pont des arts represents for clamence the collision of his true self with his inflated self image and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious a third and final incident initiates clamences downward spiral one day while waiting at a stoplight clamence finds that he is trapped behind a motorcycle which has stalled ahead of him and is unable to proceed once the light changes to green as a result other cars behind him start honking their horns and clamence politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off the road so that others can drive around him however with each repetition of the request the motorcyclist becomes increasingly agitated and threatens clamence with physical violence angry clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and informed me that i was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage camus clamence turns to respond to his interlocutor when suddenly the motorcyclist punches him in the side of the head and then speeds off without retaliating against his interlocutor clamence utterly humiliated merely returns to his car and drives away later he runs through his mind a hundred times what he thinks he should have done namely strike his interlocutor then chase after the motorcyclist and run him off the road the feeling of resentment gnaws away at him and clamence explains that clamence thus arrives at the conclusion that his whole life has in fact been lived in search of honour recognition and power over others having realized this he can no longer live the way he once did however clamence initially attempts to resist the sense that he has lived hypocritically and selfishly he argues with himself over his prior acts of kindness but quickly discovers that this is an argument he cannot win he reflects for example that whenever he had helped a blind man across the street something he especially enjoyed doing he would doff his hat to the man since the blind man obviously cannot see this acknowledgement clamence asks to whom was it addressed to the public after playing my part i would take my bow camus as a result he comes to see himself as duplicitous and hypocritical the realization that his whole life has been lived in hypocrisy and denial precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for clamence which moreover he is unable to avoid having now discovered it the sound of laughter that first struck him on the pont des arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence in fact clamence even begins laughing at himself as he defends matters of justice and fairness in court unable to ignore it clamence attempts to silence the laughter by throwing off his hypocrisy and ruining the reputation he acquired therefrom clamence thus proceeds to destroy that flattering reputation camus primarily by making public comments that he knows will be received as objectionable telling beggars that they are embarrassing people declaring his regret at not being able to hold serfs and beat them at his whim and announcing the publication of a manifesto exposing the oppression that the oppressed inflict on decent people in fact clamence even goes so far as to consider however to clamences frustration and dismay his efforts in this regard are ineffective generally because many of the people around him refuse to take him seriously they find it inconceivable that a man of his reputation could ever say such things and not be joking clamence eventually realizes that his attempts at self derision can only fail and the laughter continues to gnaw at him this is because his actions are just as dishonest in order to forestall the laughter i dreamed of hurling myself into the general derision in fact it was still a question of dodging judgment i wanted to put the laughers on my side or at least to put myself on their side camus ultimately clamence responds to his emotional intellectual crisis by withdrawing from the world on precisely those terms he closes his law practice avoids his former colleagues in particular and people in general and throws himself completely into uncompromising debauchery while humankind may be grossly hypocritical in the areas from which he has withdrawn no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures camus a quotation from samuel johnson the last of clamences monologues takes place in his apartment in the former jewish quarter and recounts more specifically the events which shaped his current outlook in this regard his experiences during the second world war are crucial with the outbreak of war and the fall of france clamence considers joining the french resistance but decides that doing so would ultimately be futile he explains instead clamence decides to flee paris for london and takes an indirect route there moving through north africa however he meets a friend while in africa and decides to stay and find work eventually settling in tunis but after the allies land in africa clamence is arrested by the germans and thrown into a concentration camp chiefly as a security measure he assures himself camus while interned clamence meets a comrade introduced to the reader only as du guesclin who had fought in the spanish civil war was captured by the catholic general and now found himself in the hands of the germans in africa these experiences subsequently caused the man to lose his faith in the catholic church and perhaps in god as well as a form of protest duguesclin announces the need for a new pope one who will agree to keep alive in himself and in others the community of our sufferings to be chosen from among the prisoners in the camp as the man with the most failings clamence jokingly volunteers himself but finds that the other prisoners agree with his appointment as a result of being selected to lead a group of prisoners as pope clamence is afforded certain powers over them such as how to distribute food and water and deciding who will do what kind of work lets just say that i closed the circle he confesses the day i drank the water of a dying comrade no no it wasnt duguesclin he was already dead i believe for he stinted himself too much camus clamence then relates the story of how a famous fifteenth century painting a panel from the ghent altarpiece known as the just judges came into his possession one evening a regular patron of mexico city entered the bar with the priceless painting and sold it for a bottle of jenever to the bartender who for a time displayed the piece prominently on the wall of his bar both the man who sold the painting and the now vacant place on the wall where it hung are cryptically pointed out at the beginning of the novel however clamence eventually informs the bartender that the painting is in fact stolen that police from several countries are searching for it and offers to keep it for him the bartender immediately agrees to the proposal clamence attempts to justify his possession of the stolen painting in a number of ways primarily because those judges are on their way to meet the lamb because there is no lamb or innocence any longer and because the clever rascal who stole the panel was an instrument of the unknown justice that one ought not to thwart camus the full story of the ghent altarpiece and the just judges panel along with its role in camus novel is told in noah charneys book stealing the mystic lamb the true story of the worlds most coveted masterpiece finally clamence employs the imagery of the ghent altarpiece and the just judges to explain his self identification as a judge penitent this essentially espouses a doctrine of relinquished freedom as a method of enduring the suffering imposed on us by virtue of living in a world without objective truth and one that is therefore ultimately meaningless with the death of god one must also accept by extension the idea of universal guilt and the impossibility of innocence clamences argument posits somewhat paradoxically that freedom from suffering is attained only through submission to something greater than oneself clamence through his confession sits in permanent judgment of himself and others spending his time persuading those around him of their own unconditional guilt the novel ends on a sinister note pronounce to yourself the words that years later havent ceased to resound through my nights and which i will speak at last through your mouth o young girl throw yourself again into the water so that i might have a second time the chance to save the two of us a second time eh what imprudence suppose dear sir someone actually took our word for it it would have to be fulfilled brr the water is so cold but lets reassure ourselves its too late now it will always be too late fortunately

at the towns shops are locked and unattended with no sign of people investigating a car sitting at an intersection hobson sees that the drivers seatbelt is still fastened telephones are dead and there is only static on the radio all humans and animals have disappeared no watch or clock shows anything other than hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them suggesting an intelligence behind the event which hobson dubs the effect a garden yields the first sign of life hobson has found a worm dug up from the soil the garden is otherwise devoid of fauna hobson wonders if he has gone mad but dismisses the idea during the night hobson hears sounds from outside approaching hobson wills the entity to leave and the sounds retreat uncertainty as to whether the presence was there or whether it may have been a stray animal spared from the effect competes in his mind with speculations that the intruder could be a manifestation of the effect hobson reassures himself that he can keep the entity at bay with mental effort the next morning hobson procures weapons and supplies and leaves for auckland finding the city deserted hobson seems to be the only human being remaining he wonders what rendered him immune to the effect hobson hurries to an apparent smoke signal coming from the north shore only to find suburban homes destroyed by the impact of a jetliner the plane was empty when it crashed hobson travels to the research unit where he worked to reactivate dormant genes in humans and animals using high frequency sound waves and radiation the units head perrin believed that awakening the dormant genes would lead to a quantum leap in evolution hobson finds perrin in a radiation chamber dead at the controls of the sound wave machine the machine appears to have short circuited but there is no evidence indicating how perrin died hobson decides he perished before the effect as dead animal tissue did not vanish hobson retrieves perrins papers then begins journeying to wellington hoping to find survivors or clues as to what happened en route to rotorua hobson sees a creature in his headlights the monster is some

survivor with a rifle the gunman is apirana maketu a m ori and a lance corporal in the new zealand army api woke up at his barracks in waiouru to find the base deserted he remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors a search of gisborne and the east coast yielded nothing and a visit to the power station at tokaanu led him to believe the electrical grid was knocked out by a massive surge api heard the same sound that hobson heard albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that hobson was standing on believing it to be a car api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south api reveals his belief that something hostile is abroad in the land it is present only in certain places and is stronger at night the soldier is both relieved and worried to find that hobson has experienced the same dread the two men seem to already know one other sharing a flash of recognition upon first meeting neither can account for this as they have never encountered each other before they arrive at the nations capital to find it devoid of life api and hobson set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the effect and the reason why he and api survived api assists hobson with procuring equipment for the scientists studies a radio transceiver is set up and the duo transmit words and morse code across the world they receive no response hobsons investigations reveal no reason for their exemption from the effect the men face the prospect that they are alone api goes skin diving for shellfish he pretends to drown as a joke and hobson reacts unconsciously by holding the other mans head underwater there is a moment of hostility when api breaks free resolved when hobson explains that his son who was autistic drowned in a bathtub and hobson felt api was making fun of this the death of the child led to the end of hobsons marriage both men realize that hobson is not in complete control of his actions visiting the beehive api speculates that they could be lab rats on some kind of duplicate earth it is they who disappeared hobson puts no stock in this theory three weeks after the effect hobson is left alone while api goes to get a new car hobson goes into apis bedroom and finds photographs of api as a private during the vietnam war posing with the mutilated corpses of viet cong hobson believes that api is a psychopath hobson feels helpless to prevent his relationship with api from deteriorating further and plans to kill api with sleeping pills after searching for a boat

is taken to the hotel and made comfortable but neither api nor hobson are medically trained unless she is less badly hurt than she seems she will die the men bicker pointlessly the womans condition worsens and there is nothing her fellow survivors can do for her hobson senses the unseen force again emanating from the empty city he speculates that the force may have always been a part of the land and is claiming the earth api studies the bible and later wakes hobson to tell him that he has solved the clock enigma relates to the number of the beast and plus and to revelation with the biblical chapters talk of men hiding from the face of god hobson does not believe this and holds a hidden gun on the deranged soldier the woman dies sending api into hysterics after another argument a full scale battle with guns and grenades ensues hobson kills api with the soldier seeming to give up the scientist is now alone breaking open perrins box hobson realizes his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance perrin believed that hobsons dna was altered due to radiation which caused his childs autism hobson believes the effect was his doing the project he worked on caused the unraveling of animal dna only those with the dormant gene pair were spared flashbacks detail hobsons last days at the research unit perrin seizes upon an accident with the sound wave radiation machine in which hobson set the sound modulator too high and was blasted out of his chair by an invisible energy wave perrin charges hobson with negligence as the sample slides for insects and animals in the machine are blank while the ones for plants are normal this event cements for hobson his long growing misgivings about the experiments and what he believes are perrins motives for pursuing them in a later flashback hobson relates how he sabotaged the sound wave machine before going on leave to output a much higher level of infrasound than the controls would register the idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily ruining perrins chance to use hobsons theories hobson took what he believed to be a fatal dose of sleeping pills on the night before the effect as he reads perrins notes hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the effect his act always had a different purpose to kill perrin believing his boss insane and consumed with a desire to play god hobson subconsciously altered his own memory to hide this fact from himself this ability to edit his own recollections and to take refuge in a kind of mental super reality is purely automatic hobson finally accepts the guilt for letting his son drown allowing his child to die was his way of destroying himself a kind of external suicide the childs autism mirrored his fathers own emptiness perhaps hobson caused the effect or is dreaming all this in a barbiturate coma or is in hell or purgatory perhaps the rest of humanity evolved or is unchanged and wondering where hobson and a handful of others have gone to with the death of the entire race on his hands hobson jumps from the hotel he gathers speed then wakes up in his motel room in thames recovering from the nightmare of falling all he can remember of the dream he was ripped from he notices that his wrist watch has stopped at

A Philosophical Investigation,Philip Kerr,in a near future a british neuroscientist named professor burgess phelan has discovered a portion of the brain the vmn that is typically twice the size in men as it is in women in certain men however approximately in it is the same size as a womans and that abnormality is an exceptionally accurate indicator of violent sociopathy professor phelan developed an imaging device called l o m b r o s o localisation of modullar brain resonations obliging social orthopraxy used to help diagnose men with the vmn deficiency in the interests of public safety the lombroso institute is set up to test all the men in britain males are enticed with ad campaigns to submit for testing those who are vmn negative are given confidential treatment including counselling and drugs and assigned a code name out of the penguin book of great thinkers e g shakespeare plato etc the police arent given the names of the vmn negative but they are allowed to confirm whether or not a particular person is in the lombroso institutes system as vmn negative wittgenstein is the code name of a vmn negative who until he was made aware of his status was living a well adjusted if solitary life venting his sociopathic tendencies harmlessly through virtual reality entertainment systems upon discovering his pathology though he undertakes a public service of his own after hacking into the lombroso institutes systems and obtaining a list of all vmn negative men in britain he undertakes to kill them all the narrative unfolds from a dual perspective wittgensteins and the female police lieutenant isadora jake jakowicz assigned to catch him wittgensteins portion is told from the first person as a diary of his assassinations and subsequent downfall the detectives portion is told in a more traditional third person perspective in the novels setting the national government was elected partly on a platform of retributive justice rather than rehabilitative and punitive coma has replaced the death penalty and to a lesser extent incarceration as punishment for extreme crimes in its favour punitive coma is safely reversed should someone later prove innocent as well prison costs have plunged since the inmates are sentenced to years of sleep rather than restraint and require much less guarding and care opponents of punitive coma of whom jake is one argue that the state is now stealing years from peoples lives and giving the guilty no opportunity to rehabilitate themselves thus punitive coma is inhumane this position is defeated however by proponents who observe that any long term space travel will necessarily involve long term medically induced comas of the same kind so the process itself is not inhumane furthermore criminals are not subject to the dangerous criminal environment of prison so punitive coma may be considered a more rather than less humane punishment an interesting portion of the narrative involves the use of a cambridge philosophy professor to engage wittgenstein in a debate on the morality of his actions since the killer comes to see his whole act through the lens of the real wittgensteins philosophy including his mid career reversal following tractatus logico philosophicus its hoped that he will be amenable to philosophical persuasion however as wittgensteins killings continue the government presses the cambridge don to talk wittgenstein into committing suicide a position with which the philosopher agrees much to jakes dismay gl a philosophical investigation

work for henry cameron a disgraced architect whom roark admires cameron who once was architectures modernist hero has fallen from fame due to the fickle demands of society and his own caustic personality his work serves as an inspiration for roark peter keating a popular but vacuous fellow student has graduated with high honors he too moves to new york where he takes a job at the prestigious architectural firm of francon heyer and quickly ingratiates himself with senior partner guy francon roark and cameron create inspired work but their projects rarely receive recognition whereas keatings ability to flatter and please brings him quick success despite his lack of originality and earns him a partnership in the firm after cameron retires from practice keating hires roark

full freedom to design it as he sees fit roark incorporates into it a statue of dominique nude which creates a public outcry toohey manipulates stoddard into suing roark for general incompetence and fraud at the trial prominent architects including keating testify that roarks style is unorthodox and illegitimate dominique defends roark but stoddard wins the case and roark loses his business again dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants in which men like roark are recognized for their greatness she will live completely and entirely in the world she has which shuns roark and praises keating she offers keating her hand in marriage keating accepts breaking his previously long held engagement with tooheys niece catherine and they are married that evening dominique turns her entire spirit over to keating hosting the dinners he wants agreeing with him and saying whatever he wants her to say she fights roark and persuades his potential clients to hire keating instead

does not know about roarks past relationship with dominique now washed up and out of the public eye keating realizes he is a failure rather than accept retirement he pleads with toohey for his influence to get the commission for the much sought after cortlandt housing project keating knows that his most successful projects were aided by roark so he asks for roarks help in designing cortlandt roark agrees to design it in exchange for complete anonymity and keatings promise that it will be built exactly as designed when roark returns from a long yacht trip with wynand he finds that the cortlandt design has been changed despite his agreement with keating roark asks dominique to distract the night watchman and dynamites the building to prevent the subversion of his vision the entire country condemns roark but wynand finally finds the courage to follow his convictions and orders his newspapers to defend him the banners circulation drops and the workers go on strike but wynand keeps printing with dominiques help wynand is eventually faced with the choice of closing the paper or reversing his stance and agreeing to the union demands he gives in the newspaper publishes a denunciation of roark over wynands signature at the trial roark seems doomed but he rouses the courtroom with a speech about the value of ego and the need to remain true to oneself the jury finds him not guilty and roark wins dominique wynand who has finally grasped the nature of the power he thought he held shuts down the banner and asks roark to design one last building for him a skyscraper the tallest building in the world that will testify to the supremacy of man build it as a monument to that spirit which is yours and could have been mine eighteen months later in the spring of the

Contact,Carl Sagan,eleanor ellie arroway is the director of project argus in which scores of radio telescopes in new mexico have been dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti the project discovers the first confirmed communication from extraterrestrial beings the communication is a repeating series of the first prime numbers a sequence of prime numbers is a commonly predicted first message from alien intelligence since mathematics is considered a universal language and it is conjectured that algorithms that produce successive prime numbers are sufficiently complicated so as to require intelligence to implement them further analysis reveals that a second message is contained in polarization modulation of the signal the second message is a retransmission of earths first television signal broadcast powerful enough to escape the ionosphere and be received in interstellar space in this case adolf hitlers opening speech at the summer olympics in berlin a third message is discovered containing over pages describing plans for a machine that appears to be a kind of highly advanced vehicle with seats for five human beings but they cannot understand the third message until they find the fourth message a primer hidden in phase modulation the primer allows them to translate the alien language to human language ultimately a machine is successfully built and activated transporting five passengers including ellie through a series of wormholes to a place near the center of the milky way galaxy where they meet the senders in the guise of persons significant in the lives of the travelers whether living or dead some of the travelers questions are answered by the senders with the senders suggesting a message is contained within one of the transcendental numbers upon returning to earth the passengers discover that what seemed like many hours to them passed by in only minutes on earth and that all their video footage has been erased presumably by the time changing magnetic fields they were exposed to inside of the wormholes they are left with no proof of their stories and are accused of fabrication therefore though ellie has traveled across the galaxy and actually encountered extraterrestrial beings she cannot prove it the government officials deduce an international conspiracy blaming the worlds richest man in an attempt to perpetuate himself embarrass the government and get lucrative deals from the machine consortiums multi trillion dollar project the message is claimed to be a fabrication from a secret artificial man made satellite s that cannot be traced because the message stopped once the machine was activated a feat that is impossible unless one considers time travel feasible and ellie and other scientists are implicated ellie a lifelong religious skeptic finds herself asking the world to take a leap of faith and believe what she and the others say happened to them she finds only one person willing to take that leap palmer joss a minister introduced early in the book ellie acting upon a suggestion by the senders of the message works on a program which computes the digits of pi to record lengths in different bases very far from the decimal point and in base it finds that a special pattern does exist when the numbers stop varying randomly and start producing s and s in a very long string the strings length is the product of prime numbers the s and s when organized as a square of specific dimensions form a rasterized circle the extraterrestrials suggest that this is a signature incorporated into the universe itself yet the extraterrestrials are just as ignorant to its meaning as ellie as it could be still some sort of a statistical anomaly they also make reference to older artifacts built from space time itself namely the wormhole transit system abandoned by a prior civilization a line in the book suggests that the image is a foretaste of deeper marvels hidden even further within pi this new pursuit becomes analogous to seti it is another search for meaningful signals in apparent noise

Thus Spoke Zarathustra,Friedrich Nietzsche,the book chronicles the fictitious travels and pedagogy of zarathustra the name of this character is taken from the ancient prophet usually known in english as zoroaster the persian founder of zoroastrianism nietzsche is clearly portraying a new or different zarathustra one who turns traditional morality on its head he goes on to characterize what the name of zarathustra means in my mouth the mouth of the first immoralist zarathustra has a simple characterisation and plot narrated sporadically throughout the text it possesses a unique experimental style one that is for instance evident in newly invented dithyrambs narrated or sung by zarathustra likewise the separate dithyrambs of dionysus was written in autumn and printed with the full volume in as the corollaries of zarathustras abundance some speculate that nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by zarathustra however the book lacks a finale to match that description its actual ending focuses more on zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth zarathustra also contains the famous dictum god is dead which had appeared earlier in the gay science in his autobiographical work ecce homo nietzsche states that the books underlying concept is discussed within the penultimate section of the fourth book of the gay science ecce homo kaufmann it is the eternal recurrence of the same events this concept first occurred to nietzsche while he was walking in switzerland through the woods along the lake of silvaplana close to surlej he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic towering pyramidal rock before zarathustra nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of the gay science e g sect this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him apart from its salient presence in zarathustra it is also echoed throughout nietzsches work at any rate it is by zarathustras transfiguration that he embraces eternity that he at last ascertains the supreme will to power this inspiration finds its expression with zarathustras roundelay featured twice in the book once near the storys close another singular feature of zarathustra first presented in the prologue is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the bermensch in english either the overman or superman or superhuman or overhuman english translators thomas common and r j hollingdale use superman while kaufmann uses overman and parkes uses overhuman martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as bermensch in his new translation the bermensch is one of the many interconnecting interdependent themes of the story and is represented through several different metaphors examples include the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud or the suns rise and culmination at its midday zenith or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the bermensch the symbol of the bermensch also alludes to nietzsches notions of self mastery self cultivation self direction and self overcoming expounding these concepts zarathustra declares the book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression it serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in nietzsches body of work he has however said that among my writings my zarathustra stands to my mind by itself ecce homo preface sec kaufmann emphasizing its centrality and its status as his magnum opus nietzsche stated that since many of the books ideas are also present in his other works zarathustra is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought with the book nietzsche embraced a distinct aesthetic assiduity he later reformulated many of his ideas in beyond good and evil and various other writings that he composed thereafter he continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns generally his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert nihilism in all of its varied forms other aspects of thus spoke zarathustra relate to nietzsches proposed transvaluation of all values this incomplete project began with the antichrist

understood stencil imagines each of the eight viewpoints as he reconstructs mdash we do not know on how much knowledge and how much conjecture mdash this episode this chapter is a reworking of pynchons short story under the rose which was first published in and is collected in slow learner in the slow learner introduction pynchon admits he took the details of the setting right down the names of the diplomatic corps from karl baedekers travel guide for egypt stencils reconstruction follows the same basic conflict as under the rose but it gives the non european characters much more personality only marginally part of the stencil v material this chapter follows benny and others as benny has a job hunting alligators in the sewers under manhattan it figures in the stencil v story in that there is a rat named veronica who figures in a subplot about a mad priest father linus fairing s j some decades back living in the sewers and preaching to the rats we hear from him in the form of his diary stencil himself makes a brief appearance toward the end of the chapter in florence in victoria appears again briefly but so does the place name vheissu which may or may not stand for vesuvius venezuela a crude interpretation of wie hei t du translating into who are you in the german language or even one character jokes venus kurt mondaugen who will appear again in gravitys rainbow is the central character in a story set in south west africa now namibia partly during a siege in at which one vera meroving is present but most notably in during the herero wars when south west africa was a german colony fausto maijstral maltese civilian suffering under the german bombardment and working to clear the rubble during world war ii writes a long letter to his daughter paola who figures in the benny profane story the letter comes into stencils hands the letter includes copious quotations from faustos diary besides the place name valletta v figures in the story as an old or possibly not so old woman crushed by a beam of a fallen building in this chapter v is entranced by a young ballerina m lanie lheuremaudit the story centers on a riotous ballet performance almost certainly modeled in part on the premiere of igor stravinskys the rite of spring the performance centers on a virgin sacrifice by impalement the young ballerina fails to wear her protective equipment and actually dies by impalement in the course of the performance everyone assumes her death throes simply to be an uncharacteristically emotional performance as the royal navy mass on malta in the early stages of the suez crisis stencil arrives with benny in tow searching for fausto maijstral as always kilroy was here first and pynchon proposes a novel origin for the face that kilroy was originally part of a schematic for a band pass filter the last chapter is a flashback to valletta when stencil sr was still alive after world war i he is sent to malta to observe the various crises going on involving the natives and their desire for independence he is implored by maijstrals wife who is pregnant with fausto to relieve him of his duties as a double agent because she fears for his life stencil sr meets vera manganese or v and implicitly has sex with her she is now largely made up of artificial limbs it is revealed they had trysted in florence after the riots he finds out that fausto is having an affair with her as well linus fairing is also working as a double agent for stencil and when he leaves for america having tired of the life of a spy stencils purpose for being in malta is null v releases stencil from her auspices and majistral as well stencil sails off into the mediterranean and a waterspout blows the ship up into the air then down into the depths not too dissimilar from the conclusion of another american masterpiece moby dick also a sailors story
Shogun: A Novel of Japan,James Clavell,japan in is a feudal country in a precarious peace the heir to the taiko is underage too young to rule and power rests in a council of five regents formed of the most powerful overlords of the land japanese society is insular and xenophobic portugal with its vast sea power and the catholic church principally through the spanish order of the jesuits have gained a foothold in japan and seek to extend their power guns and europes modern military capabilities are still a novelty and despised as a threat to japan s traditional samurai warrior culture john blackthorne an english pilot serving on the dutch warship erasmus is the first english pilot to reach japan england and holland protestant enemies of catholic spain and portugal seek to disrupt spanish portuguese relations with japan and establish ties of their own through trade and military alliance erasmus is shipwrecked on the japanese coast blackthorne and the few survivors of his crew are taken captive by a local samurai kasigi omi until the arrival of his daimyo feudal lord and uncle kasigi yabu upon arrival yabu puts blackthorne and his crew on trial using a jesuit priest to interpret for blackthorne losing at the trial blackthorne lunges desperately at the jesuit rips off the priest s crucifix and stamps it into the dust to show the daimyo that the priest is his enemy the japanese who at this point know only the catholic version of christianity are shocked at blackthorne s gesture yabu sentences blackthorne and his crew to death however omi who is quickly proving himself one of his uncle s cleverest advisers convinces yabu to keep them alive to learn more of european ways omi throws them into a pit to tame them and tells the crew lord yabu has ordered that they pick one amongst their own other than blackthorne to die so that the others may live blackthorne leads his crew in a futile attempt to resist but they are easily cowed by omi and one of his crew is taken out and boiled alive to save his crew blackthorne agrees to submit to japanese authority he is placed in a household with his crew held in the pit as hostages to ensure his submission and cooperation on omis advice yabu plans to not only exploit blackthornes knowledge to his own ends but also confiscate the wealth of guns and money recovered from the erasmus but word reaches his overlord lord toranaga the powerful president of the council of regents toranaga sends his commander in chief iron fist general hiro matsu to take the erasmus and the surviving crew from yabu to tip the balance of power against toranagas principal rival on the council ishido blackthorne is given the title anjin the japanese term for navigator or pilot by the japanese because they cant pronounce his name blackthorne insists on being addressed respectfully as omi is and is therefore known as anjin san honorable pilot hiro matsu confiscates the erasmus and takes blackthorne and yabu back to the meeting of the council of regents taking place at osaka castle the stronghold of the regent ishido they travel by one of toranaga s galleys piloted by the portuguese pilot rodrigues blackthorne and rodrigues find themselves in a grudging friendship despite being required to stay at arms length due to their national and religious enmity rodrigues attempts to murder blackthorne during a storm by sending him forward just as a wave breaks over the deck but is himself swept overboard by the next wave blackthorne not only saves rodrigues but safely navigates the ship to osaka with crew and all aboard at osaka blackthorne is interviewed by toranaga through the translation of jesuit priest father martin alvito who is not only bilingual but more sophisticated and higher up in the jesuit hierarchy in japan and therefore more dangerous to blackthorne after blackthorne demands that alvito tell toranaga that the priest is his enemy toranaga has the lady mariko monitor the priest s translations as an english protestant blackthorne attempts to turn toranaga against the jesuits he reveals to a surprised toranaga that the christian faith is divided and that other european countries intend to sail the asian waters now that the spanish armada has been defeated the stunned alvito is honorbound to translate as blackthorne the sworn enemy of his country and religion tells toranaga of the spanish and portuguese exploitation of the new world under the blessing of the catholic church and in the name of spreading catholicism the interview ends abruptly when toranagas rival ishido enters curious about the barbarian blackthorne toranaga has blackthorne thrown in prison for piracy as a ruse to keep him from ishido in prison blackthorne is befriended by a franciscan monk who reveals further details about jesuit conquests and the portuguese black ship which each year takes the vast profits from the silk trade back to europe he is taught basic japanese and a little of their culture blackthorne is taken from prison by ishidos men but toranaga intervenes capturing blackthorne from his rival in their next interview toranaga has the lady mariko translate she is a convert to christianity torn between her new faith and her loyalty as a samurai to toranaga during a subsequent interview with blackthorne toranaga is incredulous when blackthorne reveals that portugal has been granted the right to claim japan as territory by the pope during his stay at toranagas castle blackthorne is attacked unsuccessfully by an assassin who is revealed to be a member of the secretive amida tong a group of operatives who train all their lives to be the perfect weapon for one kill after the assassin is dispatched toranaga summons yabu the next day for questioning since hiro matsu says yabu would be the only one who would know how to hire them yabu is truthful but evasive in his answers adding more fuel to toranagas distrust of him it is also hinted that the jesuits may have hired the assassin to kill blackthorne to silence what he knows the council of regents negotiations go badly and toranaga is threatened with forced seppuku by the council of regents to escape the order he resigns from the council and departs the castle in the guise of his wife in a litter leaving with a train of travelers blackthorne inadvertently spots the exchange and when ishido shows up at the gate of the castle and nearly discovers toranaga blackthorne saves toranaga by creating a diversion in this way he gradually gains the trust of and enters the service of toranaga toranagas resignation from the council of regents was designed not just to avoid a seppuku order but also to paralyze the council of regents since five regents are required to make any decisions and politically a new appointment seemed unlikely toranagas party reach the coast but their ship is blockaded by ishidos boats at blackthornes suggestion the portuguese ship is asked to lend cannon to blast the boats clear but in return the jesuits seeing the presence of a protestant pilot in toranagas confidence as a grave threat will only offer aid to toranaga in exchange for physical custody of blackthorne toranaga agrees and the ship clears the coast the portuguese pilot rodrigues whose life was saved by blackthorne earlier in a storm repays his debt to blackthorne by having him thrown overboard to swim back to toranagas ship instead blackthorne slowly builds his japanese language skills and gains an understanding of the japanese people and their culture eventually learning to respect it deeply the japanese in turn are torn over blackthornes presence he is an outsider a leader of a disgracefully filthy and uncouth rabble but also a formidable sailor and navigator as such he is both beneath their contempt and incalculably valuable a turning point in this perception is blackthornes attempt at seppuku upon finding out that yabu has threatened the peasants with death if blackthorne does not learn japanese within six months in so doing he demonstrates his willingness to give his life in payment for theirs despite the christian injunction against suicide the japanese prevent this attempt as blackthorne is worth more alive but come to respect this barbarian when he rescues toranaga in an earthquake he is granted the status of samurai and hatamoto a vassal similar to a retainer with the right of direct audience as they spend more time together blackthorne comes to deeply admire mariko and they secretly become lovers in parallel with this plot the novel also details the intense power struggle between toranaga and ishido and the political maneuvering of the roman catholic church particularly the jesuits there is also conflict between christian daimyos who are motivated in part by a desire to preserve and expand their churchs power and the daimyos who oppose the christians as followers of foreign beliefs and representatives of the barbarian cultural and fiscal influence on their society blackthorne is torn between his growing affection for mariko who is married to a powerful abusive and dangerous samurai buntaro his increasing loyalty to toranaga and his desire to return to the open seas aboard erasmus to capture the black ship eventually he visits the survivors of his original crew in yedo and is so astonished at how far he has ventured from the standard european way of life which he now sees to be filthy vulgar and ignorant and is disgusted by them blackthornes plans to attack the black ship are complicated by his respect and friendship for rodrigues now piloting the vessel he returns to osaka by sea with his crew and many samurai ishido holds numerous family members of other daimyos as hostages in osaka referring to them as guests as long as he has these hostages the other daimyos including toranaga do not dare to attack him unforeseen by toranaga a replacement regent has been chosen ishido hopes to lure or force toranaga into the castle and when all the regents are present obtain from them an order for toranaga to commit seppuku to extricate toranaga from this situation mariko goes to what will be her likely death at osaka castle to face down ishido and obtain the hostages release at the castle mariko in response to toranagas orders defies ishido and forces him to either dishonor himself by admitting to holding the samurai families hostage or to back down and let them leave when mariko tries to fulfill toranagas orders and leave the castle a battle ensues between ishidos samurai and her escort until she is forced to return however she states that since she cannot disobey an order from her liege lord toranaga she is disgraced and will commit suicide as she is about to do so ishido gives her the papers to leave the castle the next day but that night a group of ninja ishido has hired slips into toranagas section of the castle to kidnap mariko with the help of toranagas vassal yabu however she and blackthorne who accompanied her but was not aware of marikos plot and the other ladies of toranaga escape into a locked room as the ninja prepare to blow the door open with explosives mariko stands against the door and declares that this is her act of honorable suicide and implicates ishido in this shameful act mariko is killed and blackthorne injured and temporarily blinded but ishido is forced to let blackthorne and all the other hostages to leave the castle seriously reducing his influence blackthorne discovers that his ship has been burned ruining his chances of attacking the black ship gaining riches and sailing home to england however mariko leaves him money and toranaga provides him with men to start building a new ship toranaga orders yabu who he learns helped the attack with the aim of being on the winning side to commit suicide for his treachery yabu gracefully complies giving his own prized katana to blackthorne saying that no one else deserved the blade a recurring motif in the book is toranaga

Goodnight Moon,Margaret Wise Brown,goodnight moon is classic childrens literature in north america the text is a rhyming poem describing a bunnys bedtime ritual of saying goodnight to various objects in the bunnys bedroom the red balloon the bunnys dollhouse the kittens etc one aspect of this book is the wealth of detail in the illustrations although the entire story takes place in a single room the careful reader or child will notice numerous details from page to page including the hands on the two clocks progress from pm to pm the young mouse and kittens wander around the room the mouse is present in all pages showing the room the cats ignore the little mouse even when it is very close to them on each page that features the bunny he is looking directly at one of the objects mentioned on that page except for the last page in which his eyes are closed and only noises are mentioned the old lady is the only element in the room that is introduced in a black and white illustration the old lady and her knitting play out a sequence of their own from page to page starting with the knitting lying on the rocking chair the old lady sitting in the chair with the ball of yarn on the floor at her feet the ball farther away and starting to be unraveled by the kittens the ball unraveled further the ball entirely rerolled and back on the old ladys lap with the kittens regarding her expectantly and finally with the lady and the knitting both gone and the kittens sleeping on the rocking chair the red balloon hanging over the bed disappears in several of the color plates then reappears at the end the string of the red balloon is not straight as it should be given the fact that the balloon is not moving as though the string is a thin curling ribbon the room lighting grows progressively darker the moon rises in the left hand window the socks disappear from the drying rack when only the mittens are being addressed and then reappear the open book in the bookshelf is the runaway bunny the book on the nightstand is goodnight moon in the painting of the cow jumping over the moon the mailbox in the right hand side of the painting occasionally disappears in the painting of the three bears the painting hanging in the bears room is a painting of a cow jumping over the moon the painting of the fly fishing bunny which appears only in two color plates appears to be black and white or otherwise devoid of color it is very similar to a picture in the book the runaway bunny the number of books on the bookshelf changes the pendulum of the bedside clock becomes harder to see as the room dims until it disappears in the final room scene the curtains have green and yellow stripes throughout the book but green and red stripes on the cover the stripes on the bunnys shirt change in the last page the word bunny is gone off the brush in the dim light not all items listed at the beginning of the story are told goodnight in the book nor are all things told goodnight announced at the beginning on the last page the mouse has eaten the mush on the last page the lights in the toy house appear to be mysteriously on and perhaps on throughout the story being revealed only by the darkening of the room

Elbow Room,Daniel Dennett,a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biological entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to us dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp sphex this insect follows a series of genetically programmed steps in preparing for egg laying if an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again for an animal like a wasp this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on this is the type of mindless pre determined behavior that humans can avoid given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly people can notice the futility of it and by an act of free will do something else we can take this as an operational definition of what people mean by free will dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility most people have seen enough of the free will issue dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair splitting aspects of the free will issue from a biological perspective what is the difference between the wasp and a person the person can through interaction with his her environment construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy the wasp with a much smaller brain and different genetic program does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will the deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a paradox on one hand we all feel like we have free will a multitude of behavioral choices to select among on the other hand modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps how do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanical components of a mechanical universe what about determinism when we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice do people just through the action of their more complex brains simply have better behaviors than wasps while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one all physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events this definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future since we have no way of performing this experiment this question is a long term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question modern day physics oriented philosophers have sometimes tried to answer the question of free will using the many worlds interpretation according to which every time there is quantum indeterminacy each possibility occurs and new universes branch off since the s physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will dennett suggests that this idea is silly how he asks can random resolutions of quantum level events provide people with any control over their behavior since dennett wrote elbow room there has been an on going attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted dennett discusses many types of free will many philosophers have claimed that determinism and free will are incompatible what the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor or if there are multiple universes to choose among the possible universes dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time dennett is able to accept determinism and free will at the same time how so the type of free will that dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book the power to be active agents biological devices that respond to our environment with rational desirable courses of action dennett has slowly through the course of the book stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will how can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice dennett emphasizes control over libertarian choice if our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us then do we really need such choice is an illusion of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense that because we base our decisions on context we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific in the most specific circumstance actual events he suggests there is only one option left to us it is this contrast between the stable and the chaotic that grounds our division of the world into the enduring and salient features of the world and those features that we must treat statistically or probabilistically and this division of the world is not just our division it is for instance mother natures division as well since for all mother nature knows or could know it is possible that these insects will cross paths sometime somewhere with insectivorous birds they had better be designed with some avoidance machinery this endows them with a certain power that will serve well in general if people are determined to act as they do then what about personal responsibility how can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave dennett gives a two part answer to this question first we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way second holding people responsible only works when combined with the fact that people can be informed of the fact that they are being held responsible and respond to this state of affairs by controlling their behavior so as to avoid punishment people who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment this is a totally utilitarian approach to the issue of responsibility there is no need for moral indignation when people break the rules of proper behavior is it then moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule yes people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them we would be worse off if we did not do so again an argument for utility one final issue if people do not have real behavioral choices why not collapse into fatalism again dennetts argument is that we may not have behavioral choice but we do have control of our behavior dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask can i even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own for dennett the answer to this question is no not really in elbow room he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have tried to make to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are in the final analysis not really important anyhow as humans we are as much in control of our behavior as anything in the universe as humans we have the best chance to produce good behavior we should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will some complaints about elbow room relate to our intuitions about free will some say that dennetts theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice one answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution the well developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value people who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival according to dennett belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will when we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources brain power evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off that we control what we do if this connection between our brains efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will then fatalism and self destructive behaviors are close at hand

Andromeda,Ivan Yefremov,this is a classic communist utopia set in a distant future throughout the novel the authors attention is focused on the social and cultural aspects of the society there are several principal heroes a historian an archeologist a starship captain involved in several plot lines though the world shown in the novel is intended as ideal theres an attempt to show a conflict and its resolution with a voluntary self punishment of a scientist whose reckless experiment caused damage theres also a fair amount of action in the episodes where the crew of a starship fight alien predators several civilizations of our galaxy including earth are united in the great circle whose members exchange and relay scientific and cultural information notably theres was no faster than light travel or communication in this world before events described in novel moreover interstellar missions sent by earth are few because of very costly fuel used by interstellar but not planetary spaceships and the great circle civilizations almost never meet in person the great circle radio transmissions are pictured as taking the energy of the whole earth and therefore infrequent one such transmission is a lecture on the history of the earth civilization which gives the author an opportunity to put his world into a historic context
Ecotopia,Ernest Callenbach,the book is set in years in the future as seen from and consists of the diary entries and reports of william weston a mainstream media reporter who is the first proper american to investigate ecotopia a newly formed country that broke from the usa in prior to westons investigative reporting most americans had not been allowed to enter the new country which is depicted as being on continual guard against revanchism the new nation of ecotopia consists of northern california oregon and washington it is hinted that southern california is a lost cause the book is presented as a combination of narrative from westons diary and dispatches that he transmits to his publication the mythical times post together with weston who at the beginning is curious about but not particularly sympathetic to the ecotopians the reader learns about the ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle that includes celebrating gender roles official encouragement of maintaining racial separation discouraging monogamy promoting sexual freedom a disdain for television and mass spectacle sports is manifested in a preference for local arts participatory sports and general fitness the ecotopians also have a peculiar ritual of voluntary mock warfare fought with actual weapons and often resulting in injuries liberal cannabis use as well as about decentralized and renewable energy production green building construction a defense strategy focused both on developing a highly advanced arms industry while also allegedly maintaining hidden wmd within major us population centers to discourage reconquest thorough going education reform is described along with a highly localized system of universal medical care the narrator discovers that ecotopian healing practices may include sexual stimulation the narrative is told through both westons official cables back to the united states and through his diary which he keeps and later sends to his editor at the end of his assignment in the diary we learn of observations he does not include in his columns including his personally transformative love affair with an ecotopian woman these parallel narrative structures allow the reader to see how his internal reflections as recorded in his diary are diffracted in his external pronouncements to his readers despite westons initial reservations throughout the novel ecotopian citizens are characterized as clever technologically resourceful emotionally expressive and even occasionally violent but also socially responsible patriotic they tend to live in ethnically separated localities and they live in extended families their economic enterprises are entirely employee owned and controlled the government is dominated by a woman led but not exclusively female party and government structures are highly decentralized the novel concludes with westons finding himself enchanted by ecotopian life and deciding to stay in ecotopia as its interpreter to the wider world

"Life, the Universe and Everything",Douglas Adams,after being stranded on pre historic earth after the events in the restaurant at the end of the universe arthur dent is met by his old friend ford prefect who drags him into a space time eddy represented by an anachronistic sofa the two end up at lords cricket ground two days before the earths destruction by the vogons shortly after they arrive a squad of robots land in a spaceship in the middle of the field and attack the assembled crowd stealing the ashes before departing another spaceship the starship bistromath arrives helmed by slartibartfast who discovers he is too late and requests arthur and fords help as they travel to their next destination slartibartfast explains that he is trying to stop the robots from collecting all the components of the wikkit gate long ago the peaceful population of the planet of krikkit unaware of the rest of the universe due to a dust cloud that surrounded its solar system were surprised to find the wreckage of a spacecraft on their planet reverse engineering their own vessel they explored past the dust cloud and saw the rest of the universe immediately taking a disliking to it and determining it must go they built a fleet of ships and robots to attack the rest of the universe in a brutal onslaught known as the krikkit wars but were eventually defeated realising that the krikkit population would not be satisfied alongside the existence of the rest of the universe it was decided to envelop the system in a slo time envelope allowing krikkit to survive long after the rest of the universe has ended the wikkit gate was the key to the envelope however just before it was activated one ship that had been presumably lost carrying a troop of robots appeared and began to retrieve the pieces of the gate after they were dispersed about space and time the three transport to an airborne party that has lasted numerous generations where another gate component the silver bail is to be found but arthur finds himself separated from the others and ends up at a cathedral of hate created by a being called agrajag agrajag reveals that arthur has killed him countless times before each time reincarnating into a new form that is soon killed by arthur and now plans to kill arthur in revenge however when he realises that arthur has yet to cause his death at a place called stavromula beta agrajag discovered he took arthur out of his relative timeline too soon and that killing him now would cause a paradox but attempts to kill arthur anyway in his insanity agrajag brings the cathedral down around them arthur manages to escape unharmed partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a piece of luggage he had lost at a greek airport years before after collecting the suitcase arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends inside they find trillian but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the bail arthur ford trillian and slartibartfast return to the bistromath and try to head off the robots activating the wikkit gate meanwhile the krikkit robots steal the last piece the infinite improbability drive core from the spaceship heart of gold capturing zaphod beeblebrox and marvin the paranoid android at the same time the bistromath arrives too late at the gate to stop the robots and transport to the planet to attempt to negotiate with the krikkit people to their surprise they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet with zaphod and marvins help the group is able to infiltrate the facilities and discover that the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer hactar due to the obvious flaw in the idea that the people of krikkit are simultaneously smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would destroy them too previously built to serve a war faring species he was tasked to build a supernova bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the universe together at the press of a button and cause the end of the universe hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead causing his creators to pulverise him into dust which thus became the dust cloud around krikkit still able to function but at a much weaker level trillian and arthur speak to hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on krikkit in order to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war also influencing their thoughts however when the slo time envelope was activated his control on the population waned as he struggles to remain functional hactar apologises to trillian and arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship with the war over the group collects the core of the heart of gold and the ashes the only two components of the wikkit gate not destroyed by the robots and returns zaphod and marvin to the heart of gold returning only moments after the robots attack at the lords cricket grounds arthur attempts to return the ashes but is suddenly inspired to bowl one shot at a wicket that is being defended using a cricket ball in his bag however in mid throw arthur suddenly realises that the ball he had was created and placed in his bag by hactar and is actually the working version of the cosmic supernova bomb and that the defender of the wicket is one of the krikkit robots ready to detonate the bomb once thrown all this causing him to trip miss the ground and allow him to fly arthur is able to throw the ball aside and disable the robot in mid throw in the epilogue the characters are taking arthur to a quiet and idyllic planet when the come across a half mad journalist he tells them that he was at a court case and a witness there was given too much of a truth drug and started to tell all truth which was driving everybody there mad they go to the courtroom in the hope of learning the question of life the universe and everything is from him they discover he is finished and he has forgotten it all in the end arthur goes to live on the planet krikkit where he becomes a more skillful flier and learns bird language

A Canticle for Leibowitz,"Walter M. Miller, Jr.",a canticle for leibowitz opens years after th nbsp century civilization has been destroyed by a global nuclear war known as the flame deluge the text reveals that as a result of the war there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons during this backlash called the simplification anyone of learning and eventually anyone who could even read was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs who proudly took on the name of simpletons illiteracy became almost universal and books were destroyed en masse isaac edward leibowitz had been a jewish electrical engineer working for the united states military surviving the war he converted to roman catholicism and founded a monastic order the albertian order of leibowitz dedicated to preserving knowledge by hiding books smuggling them to safety booklegging memorizing and copying them the orders abbey is located in the american southwestern desert near the military base where leibowitz had worked before the war on an old road that may have been a portion of the shortest route from the great salt lake to old el paso leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred later beatified by the roman catholic church he became a candidate for sainthood centuries after his death the abbey is still preserving the memorabilia the collected writings that have survived the flame deluge and the simplification in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science the story is structured in three parts titled fiat homo fiat lux and fiat voluntas tua the parts are separated by periods of six centuries each in the th nbsp century a year old novice named brother francis gerard is on a vigil in the desert while searching for a rock to complete a shelter brother francis encounters a wanderer apparently looking for the abbey who inscribes hebrew on a rock that appears the perfect fit for the shelter when brother francis removes the rock he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing relics such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a th century shopping list he soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by leibowitz his orders founder the discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to leibowitz brother francis account of the wanderer who ultimately never turned up at the abbey is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of leibowitz himself francis strenuously denies the embellishments but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred despite the lack of other witnesses abbot arkos the head of the monastery worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in leibowitzs canonization process francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil and defuse the sensationalism many years later the abbey is visited by monsignors aguerra gods advocate and flaught the devils advocate the churchs investigators in the case for leibowitzs sainthood leibowitz is eventually canonized as saint leibowitz ndash based partly on the evidence francis discovered in the shelter ndash and brother francis is sent to new rome to represent the order at the canonization mass he takes the documents found in the shelter and an illumination of one of the documents on which he has spent years working a gift to the pope on route he is robbed and his illumination taken francis completes the journey to new rome and is granted an audience with the pope francis presents the pope with the remaining documents and the pope comforts francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination however francis is murdered during his return trip by misborn people the popes children receiving an arrow in the face the wanderer discovers and buries franciss body the book then focuses on the vultures who were denied their meal they fly over the great plains and find much food near the red river until a city state based in texarkana rises in the albertian order of st leibowitz is still preserving the half understood knowledge from before the flame deluge and the subsequent age of simplification the new dark age is ending however and a new renaissance is beginning thon taddeo pfardentrott a highly regarded secular scholar is sent by his cousin hannegan mayor of texarkana to the abbey thon taddeo frequently compared to albert einstein is interested in the orders preserved collection of memorabilia at the abbey brother kornhoer a talented engineer has just finished work on a generator of electrical essences a treadmill powered electrical generator that powers an arc lamp he gives credit for the generator to work done by thon taddeo after arriving at the monastery thon taddeo by studying the memorabilia makes several major discoveries and asks the abbot to allow the memorabilia to be removed to texarkana the abbot dom paulo refuses stating he can continue his research at the abbey before departing the thon comments that it could take decades to finish analyzing the memorabilia meanwhile hannegan makes an alliance with the kingdom of laredo and the neighboring relatively civilized city states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors hannegan however is manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies leaving him in control of the entire region monsignor apollo the papal nuncio to hannegans court sends word to new rome that hannegan intends to attack the empire of denver next and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign for his actions apollo is executed and hannegan initiates a church schism declaring loyalty to the pope to be punishable by death the church excommunicates hannegan it is the year and mankind has nuclear energy and weapons again as well as starships and extra solar colonies two world superpowers the asian coalition and the atlantic confederacy have been embroiled in a cold war for years the leibowitzan orders mission of preserving the memorabilia has expanded to the preservation of all knowledge rumors that both sides are assembling nuclear weapons in space and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated increase public and international tensions at the abbey the current abbot dom jethras zerchi recommends to new rome that the church reactivate the quo peregrinatur grex pastor secum whither wanders the flock the shepherd is with them contingency plans involving certain vehicles the church has had since a nuclear incident occurs in the asian coalition city of itu wan an underground nuclear explosion has destroyed the city and the atlantic confederacy counters by firing a warning shot over the south pacific new rome tells zerchi to proceed with quo peregrinatur and plan for departure within three days he appoints brother joshua as mission leader telling him that this is an emergency plan for perpetuating the church on the colony planets in the event of a nuclear war on earth the orders memorabilia will also accompany the mission that night the atlantic confederacy launches an assault against asian coalition space platforms the asian coalition responds by using a nuclear weapon against the confederacy capital city of texarkana a ten day cease fire is issued by the world court brother joshua and the space trained monks and priests depart on a secret chartered flight for new rome hoping to leave earth on the starship before the cease fire ends during the cease fire the abbey offers shelter to refugees fleeing the regions affected by fallout which results in a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp the war resumes and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey abbot zerchi tries to flee to safety bringing with him the abbeys ciborium containing consecrated hosts but it is too late he is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbeys ancient crypts disgorge their contents among them is a skull with an arrows shaft protruding from its forehead presumably that of brother francis gerard from the first section of the book as he lies dying under the abbeys rubble zerchi is startled to encounter mrs grales rachel a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant however mrs grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion and may be dying herself as zerchi tries to conditionally baptize rachel she refuses and instead takes the ciborium and administers the eucharist to him it is implied that she is like the virgin mary exempt from original sin zerchi soon dies having witnessed an apparent miracle after the abbots death the scene flashes to joshua and the quo peregrinatur crew launching as the nuclear explosions begin joshua the last crew member to board the starship knocks the dirt from his sandals murmuring sic transit mundus thus passes the

murder the four agree to work together to solve the crime and interview the four suspects poirot takes interest in the way each member plays bridge which he discerns through asking each suspect to grade the play of the others as there seems to be no conventional way to prove which of them has committed shaitanas murder poirot suggests that the group of sleuths delve into the past and uncover the murders that the dead man thought he knew about battle is put on the trail of the death of a mrs craddock whom dr roberts once attended her husband died of anthrax poisoning from an infected

Xenocide,Orson Scott Card,the plot alternates between characters on two planets path and lusitania lusitania is an alien planet home to a curious species known as the piggies following the events of speaker for the dead we find a story of another set of characters living as a member of a brazilian catholic human colony on lusitania a unique planet inhabited by the only other two known species of sentient alien life the pequeninos little ones and the hive queen the pequeninos are native to the planet while the hive queen was transplanted to this world by ender partly in penance for his near total destruction of her formic species in enders game unfortunately the lusitanian ecosystem is pervaded by a complex virus dubbed descolada portuguese for no longer glued by humans the descolada breaks apart and rearranges the basic genetic structure of living cells its incredibly adaptable to any species or form of known life and easily transmissible the native pequeninos and other life that survived on lusitania after the descoladas introduction to the planet thousands or millions of years ago are adapted to it as a result of the deadly virus the lusitanian ecosystem is severely limited staying alive on lusitania takes immense effort and research on the part of the hive queen and the humans as they are not adapted to the descolada near the end of the story it is revealed the descolada is possibly an artificially engineered virus designed to terraform planets but the original creators of the virus are unknown and there remains a slim chance it evolved naturally after the rebellion of the small human colony on lusitania in speaker for the dead to protect the future of the intelligent alien species starways congress sends a fleet to lusitania to regain control which will take several decades to reach its destination valentine wiggin under her pseudonym demosthenes publishes a series of articles revealing the presence of the little doctor planet annihilating weapon on the fleet demosthenes calls it the second xenocide as using the weapon will result in the obliteration of the only known intelligent alien life she also claims it to be a brutal crackdown of any colony world striving for autonomy from starways congress public anger spreads through humanity and rebellions nearly ensue on several colonies after quelling much public discontent starways congress finishes their analysis of the situation while the fleet is en route fearing the descolada virus further rebellions by colony worlds and other possible unknown political motives starways congress attempts to relay an order to the fleet to annihilate lusitania upon arrival after conferring with friends on whether a cause is worth dying for jane a compassionate ai living in the interstellar ansible communication network shuts off transmissions to the fleet to block the order as a consequence of this action she risks her eventual discovery and death should the government shut down and wipe the interplanetary network no known smaller computer system can house her consciousness on lusitania itself ender attempts to find solutions to the looming catastrophes of the congressional fleet descolada virus and conflicts among the humans and intelligent alien species much on lusitania centers around the ribeira family including enders wife novinha and her children novinha and elanora the mother daughter team responsible for most of the biological advances countering the complex descolada virus are unsure if they can manufacture a harmless replacement virus conflicts arise on whether they should even do so since the descolada is intrinsically tied in with the life cycles of all lustitanian organisms and may even be sentient itself in addition to try to devise methods to escape the planet lusitanias leading troublemaking physicist grego is persuaded by ender to research faster than light travel despite grego scoffing at the idea the third biologista of the family quara is convinced that the descolada is an intelligent self aware species and deserves attempts from the humans for communication and preservation an additional sibling and catholic priest quim father estev o is determined to use faith and theology to head off another form of xenocide a group of warmongering pequenino wish to wipe out all earthborn life via starship carrying the deadly descolada within them starways congress wants its fleet back after all else fails it sends the dilemma of the fleets impossible disappearance to several citizens of the world of path a cultural planetary enclave modeled on early china paths culture centers on the godspoken those who hear the voices of the gods in the form of irresistible compulsions and are capable of significantly superior intelligence it later becomes clear that the godspoken of path are victims of a cruel government project granted great intelligence by genetic modification they were also shackled with a form of obsessive compulsive disorder to control their loyalty the experiment is set in a culture bound by five dictates obey the gods honor the ancestors love the people serve the rulers then serve your self this is a further safeguard against rebellion the superintelligent godspoken are considered the most devout and holy of all citizens and any disloyal thoughts in a godspokens mind are immediately suppressed by overwhelming obsessive compulsive behavior believed to be a sign from the gods the thoughts are wrong the most respected godspoken on path is han fei tzu for devising a treaty to prevent the rebellion of several colony worlds after the articles published by demosthenes great things are expected of his daughter and potential successor han qing jao gloriously bright while doubting the existence of the gods himself han fei tzu promised his dying wife he would raise qing jao with an unwavering belief in the godspoken the two of them are tasked by starways congress with deciphering the disappearance of the lusitania fleet han qing jaos secret maid si wang mu aids her in this task her intelligence partially unfettered by the rigid caste system the young and naive qing jao eventually traces the identity of demosthenes discovering that demosthenes is valentine wiggin enders sister but that valentine has been on a starship en route to lusitania for the last thirty years qing jao concludes that the only possible explanation is advanced computer software closely tied to the communication network this software must be hiding demosthenes and publishing her work while also causing the disappearance of the fleet all but discovered jane reveals herself to han fei tzu han qing jao and si wang mu telling them about their genetic slavery and begging forbearance on their report to starways congress already harboring suspicions about the godspokens condition han fei tzu accepts the news of congresss atrocity as does si wang mu but his daughter han qing jao clings to her belief that demosthenes and jane are enemies of the gods feeling betrayed by her father who is violently incapacitated by ocd from the disloyal thoughts qing jao argues with jane jane threatens shutting off all communications from path but si wang mu realizes this would eventually lead to the planets destruction by starways congress understanding jane to be truly alive and compassionate through tears si wang mu states jane will not block the report however qing jao compares jane to the servants in paths caste system merely a computer program designed to serve humans containing neither autonomy nor awareness knowing she has exhausted her last possibilities of stopping qing jao jane sacrifices her future and life unwilling to bring harm to qing jao or the people of path a triumphant qing jao reports the knowledge of demosthenes jane and the fate of the fleet to starways congress qing jao recommends a coordinated date set several months from the present to prepare the massive undertaking of setting up clean computers across the interplanetary network after which the transition to a new system will kill jane and allow congress full control again allowing the message to be sent jane restores communication with the fleet and congress re issues the order for the fleet to obliterate lusitania han fei tzu recovers from the incapacitation of his ocd despairing over his daughters actions and his unwitting aid in deeply brainwashing her to serve congress he and si wang mu assist jane and those on lusitania in finding solutions to their impending catastrophes planter a pequenino on lusitania offers his life for an experiment to determine whether the descolada gives pequeninos sentience or if they have the ability innately eventually elanora ribeira is able to come up with a possible model for a recolada a refit of the descolada that allows the native life to survive and retain self awareness but doesnt seek to kill all other life forms with the available equipment however the recolada is impossible to make and they are running out of time against the soon to arrive fleet while this research takes place tragedies occur on lusitania father estev o ribeira the priest attempting to sway a distant warmongering sect of the pequeninos from their goal of attacking humanity is killed grego ribeira spurs a riot of humans to burn down the warmongers forest but the violent mob gets out of his control and rampages through the neighboring pequenino forest instead massacring many of its inhabitants the original friends and allies of humanity under the terms of the treaty with pequeninos the hive queen is brought in to hold the peace setting a perimeter guard of hive drones around the human colony and preventing further escalation of violence between the two groups grego is locked in jail despite eventually stepping between the surviving pequeninos and his own riot the town realizes their horrific rage and constructs a chapel surrounding the fallen priests grave trying to find penance for their actions finally a breakthrough is made knowing the ansible communication network allows instantaneous transfer of information and through knowledge of how the hive queen gives sentience to child queens jane grego and olhado discover the outside the outside is a spacetime plane where ai as initially exist ai a is the term given to the pattern defining any specific structure of the universe whether a particular atom a star or a sentient consciousness formic hive queens are called from outside after birth giving awareness to the new body jane is able to contain within her vast computing power the pattern defining the billions of atoms and overall structure comprising a simple starship little more than a room with passengers included and take them outside by bringing them outside where relative location is nonexistent then back inside at a different spot in the physical universe instantaneous travel has been achieved finally matching the instantaneous communication of the ansibles and formics they quickly arrange to take ender ela and miro to outside while ela is outside she is able to create the recolada virus which is a safe replacement of the descolada and a cure to the godspoken genetic defect miro envisions his body as it was before he was crippled by paralysis and upon arrival in the outside his consciousness is contained within a new restored body ender discovers however the surreal unwitting creation of a new valentine and new peter wiggin from his subconscious who embody idealized forms of his altruistic and power hungry sides the recolada begins its spread across lusitania converting the formerly lethal virus into a harmless aid to native life the cure to the people of paths genetic controlling defect is distributed yet han fei tzu is tragically unable to convince his daughter qing jao this was the true course of action confronted with the possibility of being lied to all her life and dooming many sentient species to destruction or an alternative of believing all she ever loved and trusted has betrayed her demosthenes her father her friend her world she falls to the ground the young qing jao gloriously bright is lost to insanity tracing lines in wood until her death whispering to a long gone father and mother if she has finally found forgiveness her former maid and

The Rebel Angels,Robertson Davies,the rebel angels follows several faculty and staff of the fictional college of st john and holy ghost it did not quite attain the popularity of the deptford trilogy but it is generally considered to be among his best books the story like many of davies is notable for very strongly drawn and memorable characters mdash in this case the defrocked monk parlabane a brilliant and sinister sodomite with a thundering voice voracious appetite anglican priest and professor of new testament greek simon darcourt maria theotoky a graduate student researching rabelais clement hollier a frazzled and absentminded professor and urquhart mcvarish a greedy and manipulative counterpoint to hollier the novels narration alternates between theotokys and darcourts points of view darcourt is attempting to write a history of the university based on aubreys brief lives much of the story is set in motion by the death of eccentric art patron and collector francis cornish hollier mcvarish and darcourt are the executors of cornishs complicated will which includes material that hollier wants for his studies the deceaseds nephew arthur cornish who stands to inherit the fortune is also a character many of the characters including parlabane and mcvarish were based on college acquaintances of davies their stories are recounted in judith skelton grants biography robertson davies man of myth and brian busbys character parts whos really who in canlit as well many believe that davies based the college of st john and the holy ghost or spook as it is affectionately called in the novel on torontos trinity college evidence for this connection includes numerous similarities between the fictional and the real life college including architectural style layout of rooms age and religious affiliation the fact that davies taught at trinity college for years and lived across the street from trinity while master of massey college and perhaps most convincingly that a picture of trinitys central tower is prominently featured on the cover of the novels first edition equally plausible is the belief that ploughwright college in the book is patterned after daviess own massey college this connection is supported by the fact that much of the fortune donated by the massey family to the university of toronto for the founding of massey college was originally made in the manufacture of farm equipment like the real life massey college ploughwright is a graduate college where scholars are invited to partake in interdisciplinary discussions and high table dinners

to earth at st annes jane studdock has two very powerful mystical experiences the first with the earth bound counterpart of the ruling angel of venus and the second with god this occurs at the same time that mark at nice is being initiated by professor frost into a dark ritual meant to cultivate absolute objectivity by killing human emotion relegated to the status of a mere chemical phenomenon the angelic spirits that possess merlin are guardians of each of the planets of the solar system and correspond to some gods and goddesses of greek mythology merlin then disguises himself as a basque priest and answers an advertisement put out by the nice as an interpreter of ancient languages later he is brought to interview the tramp who the nice still believe may be the real merlin both merlin and the tramp are brought to attend a celebratory dinner put on by the nice in honor of the public head of nice a science popularizer named horace jules at that dinner merlin pronounces upon them the same curse that was placed on the tower of babel causing all present to speak unintelligible gibberish there are also massive earthquakes which ruin the building as well as much of the town of edgestow and cause the deaths of most of the nice personnel and the liberation of many caged animals upon whom they were conducting experiments many of the animals make their way back to st annes the angel of venus now lingers as ransom is now meant to be transported back to that planet known to the rest of the solar system as perelandra the presence of venus puts many of the animals who are there into an amorous mood mark who escaped the massacre at nice arrives on his own at st annes and sees a vision of venus who leads him into a new bridal chamber that jane has been preparing for him the couple are re united

the local british community will begin to accept her louise asks scobie if she can go and live in south africa to escape the life she hates at the same time a new inspector named wilson arrives in the town he is priggish and socially inept and hides his passion for poetry for fear of ostracism from his colleagues he and louise strike up a friendship which wilson mistakes for love wilson rooms with another colleague named harris who has created a sport for himself of killing the cockroaches that appear in the apartment each night he invites wilson to join him but in the first match they end up quarreling over the rules of engagement one of scobies duties is to lead the inspections of local passenger ships particularly looking for smuggled diamonds a needle in a haystack problem that never yields results a portuguese ship the esperan a the portuguese word for hope comes into port and a disgruntled steward reveals the location of a letter hidden in the captain s quarters scobie finds it and because it is addressed to someone in germany he must confiscate it in case it should contain secret codes or other clandestine information the captain says it s a letter to his daughter and begs scobie to forget the incident offering him a bribe of one hundred pounds when he learns that they share a faith scobie declines the bribe and takes the letter but having opened and read it through thus breaking the rules and finding it innocuous he decides not to submit it to the authorities and burns it scobie is called to a small inland town to deal with the suicide of the local inspector a man named pemberton who was in his early twenties and left a note implying that his suicide was due to a loan he couldn t repay scobie suspects the involvement of the local agent of a syrian man named yusef a local black marketeer yusef denies it but warns scobie that the british have sent a new inspector specifically to look for diamonds scobie claims this is a hoax and that he doesnt know of any such man scobie later dreams that he is in pembertons situation even writing a similar note but when he awakens he tells himself that he could never commit suicide as no cause is worth the eternal damnation that suicide would bring scobie tries to secure a loan from the bank to pay the two hundred pound fee for louise s passage but is turned down yusef offers to lend scobie the money at four percent per annum scobie initially declines but after an incident where he mistakenly thinks louise is contemplating suicide he accepts the loan and sends louise to south africa wilson meets them at the pier and tries to interfere with their parting shortly afterwards the survivors of a shipwreck begin to arrive after forty days at sea in lifeboats one young girl dies as scobie tries to comfort her by pretending to be her father who was killed in the wreck a nineteen year old woman named helen rolt also arrives in bad shape clutching an album of postage stamps she was married before the ship left its original port and is now a widow and her wedding ring is too big for her finger scobie feels drawn to her as much to the cherished album of stamps as to her physical presence even though she is not beautiful she reminds him of his daughter he soon starts a passionate affair with her all the time being aware that he is committing a grave sin of adultery a letter he writes to helen ends up in yusefs hands and the syrian uses it to blackmail scobie into sending a package of diamonds for him via the returning esperan a thus avoiding the authorities when louise unexpectedly returns scobie struggles to keep her ignorant of his love affair but he is unable to renounce helen even in the confessional so the priest tells him to think it over again and postpones absolution still in order to please his wife scobie goes to mass with her and thus receives communion in state of mortal sin one of the gravest sins for a catholic to commit shortly after he witnesses yusefs boy delivering a gift to scobie scobies servant ali is killed by teenage thieves known as wharf rats scobie had begun to doubt alis loyalty and he hinted this distrust to yusef we are led to believe that yusef arranged the death of ali although scobie blames himself for the matter in the body of his dead servant scobie sees the image of god now desperate he decides to free everyone from himself even god so he commits suicide being aware that this will result in damnation according to the teaching of the church for the sake of his life insurance he feigns symptoms of angina thus receiving a terminal prognosis from his doctor in an attempt to have his death appear natural instead his efforts prove useless in the end louise had been not as naive as he had believed the affair with helen and the suicide are found out and his wife is left behind wondering about the mercy and forgiveness of god and helen almost immediately moves on to an affair with another man
The Legacy of Heorot,Steven Barnes,two hundred colonists arrive on avalon to found a new community having made the year journey from earth in suspended animation on the starship geographic the expedition is funded by the national geographic society the colonists all selected for their outstanding physical and mental attributes make a terrible discovery though the suspended animation technology permitted them to survive the journey worked well enough it had unforeseeable side effects due to the unprecedented duration of its use their intelligence and reasoning skill are damaged some are only mildly afflicted while others have mental retardation eight cannot be reanimated at all the book opens with the colonists learning how to live without the sharp and nimble minds they all once had the colonists build a town on the island of camelot and begin growing crops and stocking the nearby waters with terrestrial species of fish to complement the samlon a local aquatic species the island seems like a paradise and the colonists quickly become overconfident in their security much to the frustration of the expedition security officer and only former soldier cadmann weyland but then unsettling events begin to happen missing animals fences torn down etc the colonists impaired minds prevent them from properly analysing what is going on and in a panic cadmann is blamed accused of deliberate sabotage to further his agenda when a baby and its mother are killed while cadmann and his only supporter are away on a hunt for the creature he believes is the cause the colonists become increasingly irrational when he returns alone his companion having been killed during the hunt badly wounded and with a chunk of burnt tissue he claims is from the monster he is drugged and restrained then the creature named by the colonists as a grendel after the character in the poem beowulf attacks the camp in revenge despite the colonists advanced weapons and larger numbers ten people are killed just to drive the grendel away this proves to all the colonists that there is a deadly and efficient predator native to the island cadmann however is now completely unwilling to assist the community he leaves the colony to set up a homestead on a bluff further up the mountain that forms the basis of the island living apart from the community in despair a woman joins him in the hopes of persuading him to return but she stays with him and eventually conceives his child as a result has an epiphany the colonists may have brutalized and betrayed him but their children are innocent and deserve to be protected he returns to assist the colony the colonists are confounded by the ecology of the island as there does not seem to be a sufficient food source for the grendels to inhabit it the colonists using new weapons and cadmanns tactics are able to kill their first grendel the autopsy reveals that grendels are crocodilian in appearance and behavior with jaws that can crush steel their bones are significantly stronger than those of humans as they are not based on calcium they have a sense of smell better than a dogs studying its brain shows it is not fully sapient but that it is not far off and is at least as smart as a gorilla its claws are not just weapons but exert enough traction for the creature to sprint up rocky cliffs though it is not a true amphibian it cannot breathe water it does possess an integral snorkel enabling it to move undetected beneath several feet of water its cardiovascular system and musculature give it strength and stamina far beyond that of humans and that is without its primary evolutionary advantage a super oxygenated blood supplement a grendel can on demand release a chemical supercharger into its blood that does to it what nitrous oxide does to internal combustion engines enable short bursts of speed in excess of a hundred miles per hour this trait makes the grendels dangerous but also the key to their destruction the supercharger when used generates large amounts of waste heat that warm up grendel bodies so rapidly they will die after using it if they do not immediately return to water to cool off with this knowledge and their technology and tactics the colonists are able to wipe out the grendel population within several months making cadmann a hero to the people who previously turned on him however the colonists make a disturbing discovery the grendels and the aquatic samlon are actually the same species their life cycle is similar to that of terrestrial frogs the herbivorous samlon are in fact the juvenile form of the carnivorous grendels like certain species of frogs they change gender over the course of their lifetimes the juvenile samlon are male the adult grendels are female interaction is unnecessary as the grendels continually lay their unfertilized eggs in the water for the samlon to fertilize and like many species of grendels they are cannibalistic if no other prey is present they will eat their own young at some point in the recent past most of the prey animals on the island were destroyed by an unknown cataclysmic event it is left to the reader to draw conclusions as to what actually happened over predation by the grendels is subtly suggested among the few surviving species on the island were the samlon and thus the grendels cannibalism became the rule instead of the exception only the fastest juvenile samlon survived predation by grendel females to become adult grendels themselves and this drove the species to evolve at an immensely accelerated rate this resulted in the incredible predatory abilities of the grendels when the colonists introduced terrestrial fish into the ecosystem they provided the grendels with an additional food source leading to a spike in adult grendel population this is why the attacks began in the first place the colonists have just exterminated the adult grendels there is now no check at all on the samlon population within a very short period of time they all become grendels instead of a few dozen grendels there are now thousands cadmann again asserts control the grendels cannot hunt away from water so the colonys pregnant women children and essential specialists are evacuated to the geographic combat is joined at first the colonists technology and tactics serve them well the laser based welding tools and plasma based drilling equipment are used as weapons whatever liquid hydrogen can be spared from the shuttles is used to fight the grendels as well cadmann observes mass grendel behavior and discovers that packs of grendels can be sent into a shark like feeding frenzy by spraying them with blood taken from dead grendels especially if it is laced with traces of the supercharger chemical extracted from the organ that secretes it as this chemical triggers an immediate fight instinct tracer bullets are also used to ignite the supercharger gland in their bodies the colonists ultimately discover and utilize a new tactic they harvest supercharger from dead grendels and spray it over the grendel horde with crop dusting equipment driving hundreds of them into a frenzy and killing many of those remaining but as the grendels numbers fall their individual strength rises every dead grendel is food for the rest eventually all that remain are full grown grendels and the colonists make a planned retreat to cadmanns bluff cadmanns carefully designed mountain hideaway which has been well stocked and reinforced with defenses as the horde approaches they are sprayed with more supercharger sending them into a frenzy once more when they begin climbing the bluff cadmann sets off an avalanche using deadfall killing even more the grendels though not as smart as humans are smart enough to learn given time and lots of experience their behavior changes as they realize the remaining colonists are not worth dying to reach when there are other grendels to kill the colony is saved a year later the grendels are being driven to extinction now that the grendel life cycle is known the colonists continue the hunts but this time the samlon are targeted as well new tactics supercharger spraying and recorded grendel challenges make them almost a chore the terrestrial fish are gone and will not be reintroduced forcing the grendels to drive their own species into extinction soon the grendel threat will be eradicated now rebuilding can begin and this time the colonists will not be caught unaware the mainland is being carefully explored and the colonists have high hopes communications with earth were cut off by the grendel wars now that it is over the colonists hope the story of their battle will inspire earths population to restart the colonization program

Critique of Dialectical Reason,Jean-Paul Sartre,critique of dialectical reason is the product of a later stage in sartres thinking during which he no longer identified marxism with the soviet union or french communism but came closer to identifying as a marxist it puts forward a revision of existentialism and an interpretation of marxism as a contemporary philosophy par excellence one that can be criticized only from a reactionary pre marxist standpoint sartre argues that while the free fusion of many human projects may possibly constitute a communist society there is no guarantee of this conscious human acts are not projections of freedom that produce human temporality but movements toward totalization their sense being co determined by existing social conditions people are thus neither absolutely free to determine the meaning of their acts nor slaves to the circumstances in which they find themselve social life does not consist only of individual acts rooted in freedom since it is also a sedimentation of history by which we are limited and a fight with nature which imposes further obstacles and causes social relationships to be dominated by scarcity every satisfaction of a need can cause antagonism and make it more difficult for people to accept each other as human beings scarcity deprives people of the ability to make particular choices and diminishes their humanity communism will restore the freedom of the individual and his ability to recognize the freedom of others

Tell England,Ernest Raymond,the novel opens with a prologue by padre monty a character from the second half of the novel padre monty speaks affectionately and retrospectively of the three boys rupert ray edgar doe and archibald pennybet as they were in childhood the inference is made that padre monty acquired this information from the boys mothers after the fact given that he first meets them in the great war the novel predates the just william books and molesworth stories but begins in a similar fashion to these books describing the school lives of rupert ray and his friends at their public school kensingstowe the author describes the pranks they play on the masters teachers from rays perspective raymond spends much of the novel setting up the characters and their relationships in this way rupert himself is a shy boy lacking in courage and in need of moral guidance in the absence of a father figure edgar nicknamed the grey doe is equally shy but is more sensitive and inclined to fall in love with older men such as their strict master radley both boys are heavily influenced by the older archibald penny who enjoys wielding youthful power over others by stirring up acts of mischief the first half of the book relates ruperts most dramatic incidents as kensingtowe including an ongoing war with his housemaster the so called carpet slippers receiving beatings and punishments learning to do what is right and his greatest hour winning the school relay swimming race only to be disqualified then made a prefect on account of his maturity in dealing with the disappointment radley is a heavy influence in all this because he offers rupert advice and encouragement to make the right choices in one memorable episode the entire class has been cheating in carpet slippers history lessons only for rupert to admit his guilt by recording a mark of zero after radleys prompting the book repeatedly makes dark suggestions as to the boys future after school for example at the end of a triumphant cricket match the masters at kensingstowe consider what england will do with the young men they are moulding radley himself is a weary beaten figure when he learns that his favourite pupils ray and doe are off to war when the war breaks out it is treated with much excitement and the boys leave school to join the army as officers where others have blamed the attitude of sending englands finest their boys to war for the mass slaughter that resulted raymonds portrayal justifies the thinking of the time the attitude is embodied by their new commanding officer the colonel eighteen by jove youve timed you lives wonderfully my boys to be eighteen in is to be the best thing in england englands wealth used to consist in other things nowadays you boys are the richest thing shes got shes solvent with you and bankrupt without you eighteen confound it its a virtue to be your age just as its a crime to be mine the boys go forward to gallipoli and despite rays pain at leaving his mother and his clear worry that he will never see her again they are still optimistic and eager to head off to war the news that penny died on the western front and that their house captain their schools most promising cricketer a sure bet for a future england side and ruperts relay team captain all died in april in gallipoli depresses edgar and rupert somewhat there is a bitter irony in this passage for all three were such promising lives that were snuffed out the moment they landed on the beaches of gallipoli by turkish guns a major theme of the novel is religious redemption and in the second half of the book padre monty becomes to ray and doe what radley was at kensingtowe he teaches them about the communion and about confession and achieves the unlikely feat of drawing confessions from both boys padre monty views the pair as his greatest triumph and is happy to be sending them out to battle white and pure still both boys have their doubts about the approaching war as their ship draws nearer to gallipoli doe is the enthusiast with high aspirations but a sensitive heart ray is slightly heavier of spirits but padre monty encourages him to seek beauty in everything at gallipoli the boys spend months waiting in a camp for any action but are finally sent to the helles where they are up against asiatic annie a mile ranging turk gun and a well placed turkish gun that kills many of their friends doe accepts the promotion to bombing officer with characteristic enthusiasm ray is promoted to captain they are both junior subalterns the rank that suffered the greatest losses in the great war owing to their courage and visibility as leaders of the front line as the germans break through servia and british and french troops at gallipoli begin to withdraw it is doe and rays unit that is required to attack as a diversion doe breaks over the top of the line and is shot in the shoulder he falls but manages to get up and blow up the offending turkish gun he is then shot four more times in the waist padre monty rushes out to bring him out of no mans land doe subsequently dies but not before ray has a tearful final farewell with his best friend the entire duration of the novel up to that point is a romantic ode to their friendship painting ruperts love for edgar in classical hues as orestes who loved pylades there is an underlying homosexual flavour to the novel with vivid descriptions of boys as magnificent creatures gods highest form of creation and britains greatest accomplishment the reader never feels that ruperts feelings for edgar are sexual but there are intimations in edgars unwillingness to confess to padre monty and his admission that he has done everything that doe himself was homosexual at the end of the novel when leaving gallipoli ray is charged by padre monty to tell england about what has happened you must write a book and tell em rupert about the dead schoolboys of your generation originally published by cassell and company tell england was most recently reprinted in when it was republished by indypublish com isbn the books name might be inspired by the famous epitaph to king leonidas and his men erected at thermopylae go tell the spartans stranger passing by that here obedient to their laws we lie the name comes from a poem that is inscribed on the grave of one of edgar and rays friends and is presumably also inscribed on edgar does given that he asked ray to do so the quote reads tell england ye who pass this monument we died for her and here we rest content one of the final messages in the book is given by padre monty to rupert ray as a means of consoling him to edgars death he says that rupert and edgars friendship is more perfect because of edgars death had they simply been school friends who went their separate ways they would eventually have lost trace of one another instead edgar will forever be inscribed upon rays memory as the war held them in deepening intimacy until the end the end of the novel is written from a trench on the western front in just as england is about to defeat germany and end the great war rupert intimates that he has finished his story in time but does not say whether he survives the final passage of war we are asked to believe that he is happy because he has lived experienced beauty known the purest of friendships and had twenty wonderful years the book ends on that note

Planet of the Apes,Pierre Boulle,the main events of the book are placed in a frame story in which jinn and phyllis a couple out on a pleasure cruise in a spaceship find a message in a bottle floating in space the message inside the bottle is the testimony of a man ulysse m rou ulysse explains that he was a friend of professor antelle a genius scientist on earth who invented a spaceship that could travel at nearly the speed of light in ulysse the professor and a physicist named arthur levain flew off in this ship to explore outer space they traveled to the nearest star system that the professor theorized might be capable of life the red sun betelgeuse which would take them about years to reach because of time dilation however the trip seems to the travelers only to last two years they arrive at the distant planetary system and find that it contains an earth like planet which they name soror latin for sister they land and discover that they can breathe the air drink the water and eat the local vegetation they get out and go swim in a lake until they see a young woman on a cliff the young woman is frightened by their traveling companion a young chimpanzee named hector and so she kills him they encounter other human beings on the planet as well although these others act as primitively as chimpanzees and destroy the clothing of the three astronauts they are captured by the primitive humans and stay with them for a few hours at the end of this time they are startled to see a hunting party in the forest consisting of gorillas and chimpanzees using guns and machines the apes wear human clothing identical to that of th century earth except that they wear gloves instead of shoes on their prehensile feet the hunting party shoots several of the humans for sport including levain and capture others including ulysse ulysse is taken to the apes city which looks exactly the same as a human city from th century earth except that some smaller furniture exists for the use of the chimpanzees while most of the humans captured by the hunting party are sold for manual labor ulysse is sent to a research facility there the apes perform experiments on the humans similar to pavlovs conditioning experiments on dogs and ulysse proves his intelligence by failing to be conditioned and by speaking and drawing geometrical figures ulysse is adopted by one of the researchers zira a female chimpanzee who teaches him the apes language he learns from her all about the ape planet eventually he is freed from his cage and meets ziras fianc corn lius a respected young scientist with corn lius help he makes a speech in front of the ape president and numerous representatives who grant him his liberty and is given specially tailored clothing it is around this time that he discovers his companion professor antelle survived the hunt and was captured being sent to the zoo and kept in captivity in a large cage with the primitive humans however when the protagonist attempts to make contact and speak with the professor it is revealed he has completely lost his mind and his faculties degenerated and behaving just as the primitive humans do ulysse tours the city and learns about the apes civilization and history the apes have a very ancient society but their origins are lost in time their technology and culture have progressed slowly through the centuries because each generation for the most part imitates those of the past the society is divided between the violent gorillas the pedantic and conservative orangutans and the intellectual chimpanzees although ulysses patrons zira and corn lius are convinced of his intelligence the societys leading orangutan scientists believe he is faking his understanding of language because their philosophy will not allow the possibility of intelligent human beings ulysse falls in love with a primitive human female nova whom he had met in the forest at the beginning of his visit to the planet he impregnates her and thus proves that he is the same species as the primitive humans which lowers his standing in the eyes of many of the apes their derision turns to fear with a discovery in a distant archaeological dig and an analysis of memory in some human brains evidence is uncovered that fills in the missing history of the apes in the distant past the planet was ruled by human beings who built a technological society and enslaved apes to perform their manual labor over time the humans became more and more dependent upon the apes until eventually they became so lazy and degenerate that they were overthrown by their ape servants and fell into the primitive state in which our protagonist found them while some of the apes reject this evidence others in particular an old orangutan scientist dr zaius take it as a sign that the humans are a threat and must be exterminated ulysse learns of this and escapes from the planet with his wife and newborn son sirius returning to earth in the professors spaceship ulysse lands on earth more than years after he had originally left it just outside the city of paris once outside the ship he discovers that earth is now ruled by intelligent apes just like the planet from which he has fled he immediately leaves earth in his ship writes his story places it in a bottle and launches it into space for someone to find it is at this point in the story that jinn and phyllis the couple who found the bottle are revealed to be chimpanzees jinn and phyllis dismiss ulysses narrative saying that a human would not have the intelligence to write such a story

street and re emerges to pay off her relatives with pounds in gold and a cheque signed by respectable gentleman dr henry jekyll a client and friend of uttersons for pounds jekyll having recently and suddenly changed his will to make hyde beneficiary utterson is disturbed and concerned about this development and makes an effort to seek out hyde this is instilled by uttersons fear that hyde is blackmailing dr henry jekyll for his money upon finally managing to encounter hyde utterson is amazed by how ugly the man seems as if deformed though utterson cannot say why exactly how this is so or why it is hyde seems to provoke an instinctive feeling of revulsion in him much to uttersons surprise hyde willingly offers utterson his address after one of jekylls dinner parties utterson stays behind to discuss the matter of hyde with jekyll utterson notices jekyll turning pale yet he assures utterson that everything involving hyde is in order and to be left alone a year passes uneventfully one night a servant girl witnesses hyde beat a man to death with a heavy cane the man is mp sir danvers carew who was also a client of utterson the police contact utterson who suspects hyde of the murder he leads the officers to hydes apartment feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather the morning is dark and wreathed in fog when they arrive at the apartment the murderer has vanished but they find half of the cane described as being made of a strong wood but broken due to the beating left behind a door it is revealed to have been given to jekyll by utterson shortly thereafter utterson again visits jekyll who now claims to have ended all relations with hyde jekyll shows utterson a note allegedly written to jekyll by hyde apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye that night however uttersons clerk points out that hydes handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to jekylls own for a few months jekyll reverts to his former friendly and sociable manner as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders later jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors and dr hastie lanyon a mutual acquaintance of jekyll and utterson dies suddenly of shock after receiving information relating to jekyll before his death lanyon gives utterson a letter with instructions that he not open it until after jekylls death or disappearance utterson goes out walking with enfield and they see jekyll at a window of his laboratory the three men begin to converse but a look of horror suddenly comes over jekylls face and he slams the window and disappears soon afterward jekylls butler mr poole visits utterson in a state of desperation and explains that jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks utterson and poole travel to jekylls house through empty windswept sinister streets once there they find the servants huddled together in fear they go to see the laboratory where they hear that the voice coming from inside is not the voice of jekyll and the footsteps are light not the heavy footsteps of the doctor after arguing for a time the two of them resolve to break into jekylls laboratory inside they find the body of hyde wearing jekylls clothes and apparently dead from suicide they find also a letter from jekyll to utterson promising to explain the entire mystery utterson takes the document home where first he reads lanyon s letter and then jekylls the first reveals that lanyon s deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing mr hyde drink a serum or potion and as a result of doing so metamorphose into dr jekyll the second letter explains that jekyll seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a creature free of conscience this being mr hyde the transformation was incomplete however in that it created a second evil identity but did not make the first identity purely good at first jekyll reports he delighted in becoming hyde and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed eventually however he found that he was turning into hyde involuntarily in his sleep even without taking the potion at this point jekyll resolved to cease becoming hyde one night however the urge gripped him too strongly and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed sir danvers carew horrified jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations and for a time he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work at a park he considers how good a person he has become as a result of his deeds in comparison to others believing himself redeemed however before he completes his line of thought he looks down at his hands and realizes that he has suddenly once again become mr hyde this was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer hyde needed lanyons help to get his potions and become jekyll again when he undertook the transformation in lanyons presence the shock of the sight instigated lanyons deterioration and death meanwhile jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves it was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with enfield and utterson eventually the stock of ingredients from which jekyll has been preparing the potion ran low and subsequent batches prepared by jekyll from renewed stocks of the ingredients failed to produce the transformation effected by the original potion jekyll speculates that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work must have been a trace contaminant that was absent from the ingredients he had subsequently purchased he assumes that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments his ability to change back from hyde into jekyll has slowly vanished in consequence jekyll writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become hyde permanently and he wonders if hyde will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself jekyll notes that in either case the end of his letter marks the end of the life of dr jekyll he ends the letter saying i bring the life of that unhappy henry jekyll to an end with these words both the document and the novel come to a close
