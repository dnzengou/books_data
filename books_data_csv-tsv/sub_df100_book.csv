Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes,the first sally alonso quijano the protagonist of the novel is a retired country gentleman nearing fifty years of age living in an unnamed section of la mancha with his niece and housekeeper while mostly a rational man of sound reason his reading of books of chivalry in excess has had a profound effect on him leading to the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties in essence he believes every word of these books of chivalry to be true though for the most part the content of these books is clearly fiction otherwise his wits in regards to everything other than chivalry are intact he decides to go out as a knight errant in search of adventure he dons an old suit of armour renames himself don quixote de la mancha and names his skinny horse rocinante he designates a neighboring farm girl as his lady love renaming her dulcinea del toboso while she knows nothing about this he sets out in the early morning and ends up at an inn which he believes to be a castle he asks the innkeeper whom he thinks to be the lord of the castle to dub him a knight he spends the night holding vigil over his armor where he becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules the innkeeper then dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way don quixote next frees a young boy who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master by making his master swear on the chivalric code to treat the boy fairly the boys beating is continued as soon as quixote leaves don quixote has a run in with traders from toledo who insult the imaginary dulcinea one of whom severely beats don quixote and leaves him on the side of the road don quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant the second sally while don quixote is unconscious in his bed his niece the housekeeper the parish curate and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off after a short period of feigning health don quixote approaches his neighbor sancho panza and asks him to be his squire promising him governorship of an island the uneducated sancho agrees and the pair sneak off in the early dawn it is here that their series of famous adventures begin starting with don quixotes attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants the two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage they are heavily cloaked as is the lady to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road don quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive he knocks a friar from his horse and is immediately challenged by an armed basque traveling with the company as he has no shield the basque uses a pillow to protect himself which saves him when don quixote strikes him the combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and demanding those traveling with her to surrender to don quixote the pastoral wanderings sancho and don quixote go on and fall in with a group of goatherds don quixote tells sancho and the goatherds about the golden age of man reminiscent of both ovid and the later rousseau in which property does not exist and men live in peace the goatherds invite the knight and sancho to the funeral of gris stomo once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels seeking the shepherdess marcela at the funeral marcela appears delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by gris stomo claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich s she disappears into the woods and don quixote and sancho follow ultimately giving up the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest some galicians arrive to water their ponies and rocinante don quixotes horse attempts to mate with the ponies the galicians hit rocinante with clubs to dissuade him which don quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend rocinante the galicians beat don quixote and sancho leaving them in great pain the adventures with cardenio and dorotea after don quixote frees a group of galley slaves the knight and sancho wander into the sierra morena and there encounter the dejected cardenio cardenio relates the first part of his story in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend luscinda and is hired as the companion to the dukes son leading to his friendship with the dukes younger son don fernando cardenio confides in don fernando his love for luscinda and the delays in their engagement caused by cardenios desire to keep with tradition after reading cardenios poems praising luscinda don fernando falls in love with her don quixote interrupts when cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels in the course of their travels the protagonists meet innkeepers prostitutes goatherds soldiers priests escaped convicts and scorned lovers these encounters are magnified by don quixote s imagination into chivalrous quests don quixote s tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him and his habit of not paying his debts result in many privations injuries and humiliations with sancho often getting the worst of it finally don quixote is persuaded to return to his home village the author hints that there was a third quest but says that records of it have been lost the third sally although the two parts are now normally published as a single work don quixote part two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel while part one was mostly farcical the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception as part two begins it is assumed that the literate classes of spain have all read the first part of the history of don quixote and his squire cervantess meta fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of part one as well as with an actually published fraudulent part two when strangers encounter the duo in person they already know their famous history a duke and duchess and others deceive don quixote for entertainment setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes some of them are quite sadistic and they put don quixotes sense of chivalry and his devotion to dulcinea through many tests even sancho deceives him at one point pressured into finding dulcinea sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls and tells don quixote that they are dulcinea and her ladies in waiting when don quixote only sees the peasant girls sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when as part of one of the duke and duchesss pranks the two are led to believe that the only method to release dulcinea from her spell is for sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes sancho naturally resists this course of action leading to friction with his master under the dukes patronage sancho eventually gets a governorship though it is false and proves to be a wise and practical ruler though this ends in humiliation as well near the end don quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity an inn is just an inn not a castle the lengthy untold history of don quixotes adventures in knight errantry comes to a close after his battle with the knight of the white moon in which we the readers find him conquered bound by the rules of chivalry don quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror which in this case is that don quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year a duration in which he may be cured of his madness defeated and dejected he and sancho start their journey home part two of don quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about this is a theme much explored in writings of the th century upon returning to his village don quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd although his housekeeper who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs soon after he retires to his bed with a deathly illness possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations one day he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity sancho tries to restore his faith but alonso quixano for that is his true name can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused he dictates his will which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry after alonso quixano dies the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about don quixote would be spurious
Dune Messiah,Frank Herbert,twelve years after the events described in dune paul muaddib atreides rules as emperor by accepting the role of messiah to the fremen paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe while paul is the most powerful emperor ever known he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created although sixty one billion people have perished pauls prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity motivated by this knowledge paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the fremen religion the bene gesserit spacing guild and tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone paul the bene gesserit reverend mother gaius helen mohiam enlisting pauls own consort princess irulan daughter of the deposed padishah emperor shaddam corrino iv paul has refused to father a child with irulan or even touch her but his fremen concubine chani has also failed to produce an heir causing tension within his monarchy desperate both to secure her place in the atreides dynasty and to preserve the atreides bloodline for the bene gesserit breeding program irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to chani paul is aware of this fact but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring chanis death and does not want to lose her because of the way oracles interfere with one anothers prescience the guild navigator edric is able to shield the conspiracy from pauls visions of the future the tleilaxu face dancer scytale gives paul a gift he cannot resist a tleilaxu grown ghola of the deceased duncan idaho pauls childhood teacher and friend now called hayt the conspirators hope the presence of hayt will undermine pauls ability to rule by forcing paul to question himself and the empire he has created furthermore pauls acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the fremen who see the tleilaxu and their tools as unclean chani taking matters into her own hands switches to a traditional fremen fertility diet preventing irulan from being able to tamper with her food and soon becomes pregnant otheym one of pauls former fedaykin death commandos reveals evidence of a fremen conspiracy against paul otheym gives paul his dwarf tleilaxu servant bijaz who like a recording machine can remember faces names and details paul accepts reluctantly seeing the strands of a tleilaxu plot as pauls soldiers attack the conspirators others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner purchased from the tleilaxu that destroys the area and blinds paul by tradition all blind fremen are abandoned in the desert but paul shocks the fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see even without eyes his oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens as though his eyes still function by moving through his life in lockstep with his visions he can see even the slightest details of the world around him the disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted the unraveling of the fremen conspiracy reveals that korba a former fedaykin and now high priest of pauls church is among pauls enemies hayt interrogates bijaz but the little man actually an agent of the tleilaxu uses a specific humming intonation that renders hayt open to implanted commands bijaz programs hayt to offer paul a bargain when chani dies chanis rebirth as a ghola and the hope that duncan idahos memories might be reawakened in return for paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force hayt to attempt to kill paul given the appropriate circumstances hayt remains oblivious of the programming eventually news is brought that chani has died giving birth pauls reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of hayt who attempts to kill paul but rather than kill his beloved paul duncans ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers duncans full consciousness he remains conscious of the zen sunni and mentat training given to hayt by the tleilaxu but is no longer bound to their programming paul and chanis newborn twins are pre born like pauls sister alia had been and come into the world fully conscious with kwisatz haderach like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in chanis special pregnancy diet scytale offers to revive chani as a ghola in return for all of pauls choam holdings paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the tleilaxu might program chani in some diabolical way and scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with alia paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son yet he is able to kill scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his sons perspective now prophetically as well as physically blind paul chooses to embrace the fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert winning the fealty of the fremen for his children who will inherit his mantle of emperor paul leaves alia now romantically involved with duncan as regent for the twins whom he has named leto and ghanima duncan notes the irony that paul and chanis deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies and that paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man while

Darwin's Dangerous Idea,Daniel Dennett,starting in the middle part i of darwins dangerous idea gets its name from a quote by willard van orman quine analyze theory building how we will we all must start in the middle our conceptual firsts are middle sized middle distance objects and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race the first chapter tell me why is named after a song before charles darwin god was seen as the ultimate cause of all design or the ultimate answer to why questions john locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter and david hume while exposing problems with lockes view could not see any alternative darwin provided just such an alternative evolution besides providing evidence of common descent he introduced a mechanism to explain it natural selection according to dennett natural selection is a mindless mechanical and algorithmic process mdash darwins dangerous idea the third chapter introduces the concept of skyhooks and cranes see below he suggests that resistance to darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks which do not really exist according to dennett good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes chapter looks at the tree of life such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in lifes history the next chapter concerns the possible and the actual using the library of mendel the space of all logically possible genomes as a conceptual aid in the last chapter of part i dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified design space descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently however there are also forced moves or good tricks that will be discovered repeatedly either by natural selection see convergent evolution or human investigation the first chapter of part ii darwinian thinking in biology asserts that life originated without any skyhooks and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos the eighth chapters message is conveyed by its title biology is engineering biology is the study of design function construction and operation however there are some important differences between biology and engineering related to the engineering concept of optimization the next chapter deals with adaptationism which dennett endorses calling gould and lewontins refutation of it an illusion dennett thinks adaptationism is in fact the best way of uncovering constraints the tenth chapter entitled bully for brontosaurus is an extended critique of stephen jay gould who dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings his self styled revolutions against adaptationism gradualism and other orthodox darwinism all being false alarms the final chapter of part ii dismisses directed mutation the inheritance of acquired traits and teilhards omega point and insists that other controversies and hypotheses like the unit of selection and panspermia have no dire consequences for orthodox darwinism mind meaning mathematics and morality is the name of part iii which begins with a quote from nietzsche chapter the cranes of culture discusses cultural evolution it asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture and that it allows humans alone among animals to transcend our selfish genes losing our minds to darwin follows a chapter about the evolution of brains minds and language dennett criticizes noam chomskys perceived resistance to the evolution of language its modeling by artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the evolution of meaning is then discussed and dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless algorithmic processes chapter asserts that g dels theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible dennett extends his criticism to roger penrose the subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality beginning with thomas hobbes who dennett calls the first sociobiologist and friedrich nietzsche he concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense though he cautions against some varieties of greedy ethical reductionism before moving to the next chapter he discusses some sociobiology controversies the penultimate chapter entitled redesigning morality begins by asking if ethics can be naturalized dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems in the future of an idea the books last chapter dennett praises biodiversity including cultural diversity in closing he uses beauty and the beast as an analogy although darwins idea may seem dangerous it is actually quite beautiful

montag finds mildred in the kitchen making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed but is interrupted by mildreds ramblings of her stomach hurting but being hungry and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party as montag leaves for work he finally tells mildred who is watching an interactive soap opera

when the train comes to take him to work a few days later the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books the firemen go to arrest her but instead the

accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see the woman is given a final warning to leave the house but the woman produces a match before she can strike it the firemen flee save for montag who watches as the woman lights the match drops it in the kerosene and is engulfed in flames montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half asleep mildred where the two first met and when mildred tries to remember but cant laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills as montag reflects on his stagnant stilted marriage to mildred and how mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her parlor wall entertainment driving recklessly and her sleeping pill addiction montag begins to cry after realizing that if mildred died he wouldnt miss her at all montag then asks mildred about clarisse and her whereabouts mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to clarisse then tells montag exactly what happened to her clarisse was run over by a speeding car and once her family heard the news about her death they packed up and moved away all of

wakes up physically ill and begs mildred to call in sick for him mildred refuses and doesnt believe that montag is really sick even when montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene which earlier was like a perfume to him mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash captain beatty montags fire chief personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in over the course of several decades with the starting point being after the american civil war populations grew and people embraced new media sports and a quickening pace of life books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span later minorities and other special interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend books became blander and blander due to censorship measures and eventually books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile the only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics three dimensional sex magazines trade magazines and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls to get rid of the books from the past and their copies the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire resistant and placate the masses as beatty is giving his monologue mildred tries to fluff montags pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath montag yells at her and mildred at the request of beatty quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls beatty knows that montag has a book but acts casual about it stating that its natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one if the book isnt burned or returned to the firehouse

the stolen books and nearly getting caught by the firehouses mechanical hound mildred argues with montag that books have no meaning and questions why montag dragged her into this montag snaps back by mentioning mildreds overdose clarisses death the book woman who burned herself and how society is falling apart due to apathy ignorance and a pending war then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction before montag can finish mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch the white clown on the parlor walls montag laments that his wife is a lost cause and he will be too if he cant force himself to absorb the information in the books montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago faber a former english professor montag seeks fabers help though faber refuses at first due to his cowardice after montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of the new testament one of the few left that actually contains gods word rather than the bastardized versions that have jesus and other biblical characters shilling products faber relents and teaches montag about the importance of literature in its attempt to explain human existence he gives montag an ear piece communicator he made himself so that faber can offer guidance throughout his daily activities at montags house mildred has friends mrs phelps and mrs bowles over to watch the parlor walls in the middle of a bloody demolition derby montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war death their families and politics montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them despite fabers warnings mildred tries to cover up montags actions by claiming that once a year firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem dover beach on it and assures that none of her friends will understand any of the words a shaken confused montag reads the poem which ends up making mrs phelps cry mrs bowles however is disgusted accuses montag of being nasty and breaks off her friendship with mildred montag yells at the women to go home and reflect on their empty lives and burns the poetry book while mildred locks herself in the bathroom to take her pills montag returns to the firehouse the next day with only one of the books which beatty tosses into the trash beatty tells montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other in describing the dream beatty shows that despite his disillusionment he was once an enthusiastic reader a fire alarm goes off and

God Emperor of Dune,Frank Herbert,the seemingly immortal god emperor leto ii has ruled his empire for more than years his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in children of dune to merge his human body with sandtrout the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of arrakis his continued evolution has slowly transformed him altering his human form into what he calls a pre worm his body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of arrakis mdash ribbed elongated and covered in scaly sandtrout his face remains as do his hands and arms but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of ixian manufacture it is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form this distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm even allowing him to survive lasgun fire but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water during his long reign leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire both through tight control of his enormous but limited hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his fish speaker army the old imperium is basically non existent the landsraad has ceased to exist and only a few remnants of the great houses survive the bene gesserit and spacing guild have endured although both have been forced to adapt to letos absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience and choam has been reduced to a shadow of its former self his reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race letos enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life close to absolute prescience a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths as decades may pass without him realizing it few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the golden path the end justifying the means leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government and as god he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept as his father before him leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive mdash and thus control mdash is connected to his eventual death ironically this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of duncan idaho the faithful swordmaster of house atreides duncan functions both as the captain of letos guard and as a familiar face to calm leto in his moments of distress they remind leto of his family and he feels that he owes duncan for his service and devotion to house atreides the vast majority of these gholas are made under letos instructions of preserving the original idaho without enhancements idahos masterful abilities thus are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by letos servants over the centuries a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to house atreides and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation leto has forced upon the empire these feelings compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time drives some of the duncan idaho gholas insane even when he doesnt ask for a new ghola or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous idahos demise the tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival letos golden path as he calls it is a millennia spanning attempt to produce a human who is invisible to a watcher gifted with prescience this breeding plan begun with the marriage of letos twin sister ghanima to faradn corrino has resulted in letos majordomo moneo atreides and his daughter siona moneo has served leto faithfully for the majority of his life having been a rebel until he was shown the golden path in a test by leto siona is the leader of a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the god emperor and locate his hidden hoard of melange unbeknownst to siona nayla mdash her close friend and de facto bodyguard mdash worships leto and is under orders to protect and obey siona in all things while reporting on her rebellious activities although leto knows the important purpose of siona as long as she doesnt serve the golden path she would be expendable and he would have to take measures for the breeding paths that he would have to take to replace her during a raid on his citadel siona and her friends steal among other things a series of excerpts from letos private journal unknown to them leto is aware of their activities and allows them to continue in perusing some of the items and documents stolen from the citadel siona learns that leto remains capable of love and plots to use this as a weapon against him at the same time the new ixian ambassador hwi noree is sent to the court of the god emperor immediately entranced by her beauty grace and purity leto begins to be tortured by the knowledge that he and hwi are separated by his continued transformation for her part hwi desires nothing more than to serve the god emperor and she quickly becomes a confidante finally expressing her love of leto the latest incarnation of duncan is also captivated by hwis beauty but is rebuffed by leto who warns that hwi is his alone because of his intense feelings for hwi and the fact that she had never appeared in his prescient visions leto realizes that she is a trap trained and sent by the ixians to weaken him however he is unable to send her away and she gladly accepts his offer to remain it is revealed that hwi had been grown inside an ixian no room mdash a device that shields its occupants from prescient view mdash from cells of a former ixian ambassador malky who had been a cynical and roguish friend of the god emperor through discussions with moneo and leto duncan learns about letos transformation the fish speakers and the oppressive measures leto takes to maintain his absolute control over the empire he begins to grow more agitated and restless though he continues in his duties defending the god emperor from an attack by tleilaxu face dancers duncan struggles with feelings of inadequacy and the confusion and disorientation that result from existing in a time alien to him duncan meets siona and though the two of them are coldly formal to one another they eventually unite to kill leto and end his tyrannical rule over mankind leto and hwi decide to marry and lead a wedding procession from letos little citadel to tuono village where duncan and siona have been sent while crossing the idaho river siona orders nayla to cut the supports of the bridge with a lasgun spilling moneo hwi leto and a number of courtiers into the jagged rocks in the canyon below nayla obeys despite her fanaticism toward the god emperor believing that the instructions are a test of her loyalty leto survives the fall but is immersed in water and his body begins to dissolve just as did the sandworms of ancient dune in a final conversation with siona and duncan leto reveals that siona is the embodiment of the golden path a human completely shielded from prescient view he explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles free to scatter throughout the universe never again to face complete domination after revealing the location of his secret spice hoard leto dies leaving duncan and siona to face the task of managing the empire

Heart of Darkness,Joseph Conrad,heart of darkness opens in first person narrative our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat the nellie a cruising yawl anchored in the thames river near gravesend england it is somewhat hazy and late in the day aboard are four others the director of companies the captain the lawyer the best of old fellows the accountant toying architecturally with dominoes and marlow charlie marlow all share the bond of the sea but marlow is the only one that still followed the sea they are waiting for the tide waters to turn some undefined conversation is shared lazily the sun sets then marlow states how their location also has been one of the dark places of the earth marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first romans who made their way to england how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them he also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these romans must have been they were conquerors and for that you want only brute force after some silence marlow abruptly starts up again saying in a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn fresh water sailor for a bit marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river steamboat for an ivory trading company he describes his passage on ships to the wilderness to the companys station which strikes marlow as a scene of devastation amongst a waste of excavations disorganized machinery parts here and there now and then explosions of demolition weakened native black men that have been demoralized in chains literally being worked to death and strolling behind them a white company man in a uniform carrying a rifle marlow remarks on these company men ive seen the devil of violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by all the stars these were strong lusty red eyed devils that swayed and drove men men i tell you but as i stood on this hillside i foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become acquainted with a flabby pretending weak eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly how insidious he could be too i was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther at this station marlow meets the companys chief accountant whos dressed in unexpected elegance everything else in the station was in a muddle marlow first hears of a mr kurtz from the chief accountant who explains that kurtz is a first class agent and later adds he will be a somebody in the administration before long they above the council in europe you know mean him to be marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness to the central station where his steamboat is based the steamer he is to captain upon arrival at the central station the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival the manager explains to marlow that they couldnt wait and needed to take the steamboat up river because of rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy and its chief mr kurtz was ill marlow describes that the manager inspired uneasiness just uneasiness nothing more along with the manager marlow describes the other company men at this station as lazy back biting pilgrims fraught with envy and jealousy all trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the company which in turn would carry more personal profit but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting while trying to stay out of harms way after fishing his command out of the river frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs during this time marlow learns that at this station mr kurtz is far from being admired but instead more or less kurtz is resented mostly by the manager not only is kurtzs position at the inner station a highly envied position but sentiment seems to be that kurtz is not deserving of it as kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in europe once ready and underway the journey up river to the inner station kurtzs station takes two months to the day on board was the manager three or four pilgrims and about twenty cannibals that were enlisted to crew the steamer marlow describes the brooding wilderness in all its glory and in all its mystery here and there would be a company post where company agents seemed imprisoned captive by the business of ivory now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen with a frenzied uproar by the natives marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting kurtz but things become more tense as they get closer to his station they come to rest for the night about eight miles below the inner station in the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog from the river bank they hear a very loud cry followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking which stopped short the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap many wondered if there would be an attack but it was not until a few hours onwards while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks little arrows everywhere aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore the little arrows looked as though they wouldnt kill a cat the pilgrims with their winchesters had opened fire into the bush the native who had been serving as helmsman gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river the helmsman fell at marlows feet clutching a shaft of a spear which had entered his body just below the ribs marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out sharply then silence a pilgrim in pink pyjamas arrives at the pilot house and is shocked to see the dying helmsman they watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face marlow forces the pilgrim in pink pyjamas to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes and while flinging the pair overboard he is hit with a rush of thoughts thinking he would never have a chance to hear kurtz talk as he is most likely dead then submits of course i was wrong the privilege was waiting for me oh yes i heard more than enough marlow makes a vague mention of a girl whom later kurtz will refer to as my intended his fianc e you should have heard him say my ivory oh yes i heard him my intended my ivory my station my river my everything belonged to him marlow reflects more on kurtz his mother was half english his father was half french all europe contributed to the making of kurtz i learned that most appropriately the international society for the suppression of savage customs had entrusted him with the making of a report for its future guidance and he had written it too ive seen it ive read it it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of a method it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying like a flash of lightning in a serene sky exterminate all the brutes the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career after reflecting more on kurtz marlow states i cant forget him though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him i missed my late helmsman awfully dont you see he had done something he had steered and thus a subtle bond had been created of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken after putting on a pair of slippers marlow returned to the pilot house and resumed steering by this time the manager is there and expresses a strong desire to turn back right at the moment that the inner station comes into view at kurtzs station marlow sees a man on the river bank waving his arm urging them to land because of his expressions gestures and all the colorful patches on his clothing the man reminds marlow of a harlequin the pilgrims heavily armed escort the manager on shore to retrieve mr kurtz the harlequin like chap boards the steamboat it turns out the man is russian and he is a mere wanderer who just happened to wander into kurtzs camp he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case dont you talk with mr kurtz i said you dont talk with that man you listen to him he exclaimed with severe exaltation i tell you he cried this man has enlarged my mind through conversation marlow discovers just how wanton kurtz could be how the natives worshiped kurtz and how very ill kurtz has been of late the concerned harlequin like russian admires mr kurtz for his intellect for his insights into love life and justice the russian seems to even admire kurtz for his power and his willingness to use it marlow suggests that kurtz has gone mad and the russian protested indignantly mr kurtz couldnt be mad if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldnt dare hint at such a thing from the steamboat through a glass telescope marlow can observe details of the station and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared bearing kurtz on an improvised stretcher the area then filled with natives who appeared to be ready for battle the russian stated now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for on the stretcher marlow could see kurtz shouting the pilgrims carried kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins a gorgeous native woman with a desperate aspect walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer she raised her arms above her head then turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into the bushes from the steamboats cabin kurtz was placed in he is heard yelling at the manager save me save the ivory you mean dont tell me save me why ive had to save you you are interrupting my plans now sick sick not so sick as you would like to believe the manager walks out of the cabin and spoke with marlow about unsound methods and marlow puts forward the notion no method at all after some more words the manager gives marlow a heavy glance then leaves the russian mentions matters that would affect mr kurtzs reputation marlow replied to the russian mr kurtzs reputation is safe with me he informed marlow that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer the harlequin like russian refers to a canoe waiting for him and adds ah ill never never meet such a man again you ought to have heard him recite poetry his own too it was he told me poetry he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights oh he enlarged my mind good bye said i he shook hands and vanished in the night later after midnight marlow discovers that kurtz has left his cabin he has left the steamer and has returned to shore marlow goes ashore and finds kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station but not so weak as he can still call out to the natives marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in and when kurtz begins a threatening tone marlow interjects that his success in europe is assured in any case kurtz agrees to allow marlow to help him back to the steamer the next day they prepare for their departure they carried kurtz to the pilot house there was more air there the natives once again assembled on shore and the native woman returned they all began to shout marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore only the woman remained unmoved with outstretched arms the pilgrims opened fire the current was swift as they headed downstream kurtzs health was worsening marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill the steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made kurtz gives marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager while ill marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap unless i had the shakes too bad to stand he did not have much time for kurtz one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously i am lying here in the dark waiting for death the light was within a foot of his eyes i forced myself to murmur oh nonsense and stood over him as if transfixed as kurtz dies marlow hears him whisper in no more than a breath the horror the horror marlow blew out the candle and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims who were all in the mess room dining with the manager in a short while the managers boy appears and announces in a scathing tone mistah kurtz he dead next day marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury something in a muddy hole and then they very nearly buried me marlow falls very sick near death himself i have wrestled with death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine i was within a hairs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man he had something to say he said it since i had peeped over the edge myself i understand better he had summed up he had judged the horror he was a remarkable man after all this was the expression of some sort of belief it had candour it had conviction it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth the strange commingling of desire and hate he had made that last stride he had stepped over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible perhaps i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt better his cry much better upon marlows return to europe he seems embittered the everyday life of the europeans seem to be something a sham like some sort of hoax eventually marlow took care of the bundle of papers kurtz had entrusted to him to a clean shaven man who had an official manner marlow gave the paper entitled suppression of savage customs with the postscriptum torn off to another who claims to be kurtzs cousin marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance to a journalist he gave a report for publication if the journalist saw fit finally marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girls portrait kurtzs fianc e his intended at her door even before marlow entered her house memories of kurtz began to flow along with the final words that he whispered the girl came forward dressed in black and met marlow in a drawing room although it has been more than a year since kurtz died she was still in mourning it was late and the room was growing darker the final words of kurtzs seemed to echo in the room with the girl marlow envisioned them together i saw her and him in the same instant of time his death and her sorrow i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death she presses marlow for information ultimately asking him to repeat the final words kurtz had spoken being very uncomfortable marlow tells her that the final words that kurtz pronounce was her name marlow was surprised by her reaction i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain i knew it i was sure she knew she was sure i heard her weeping i wonder if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due hadnt he said he wanted only justice but i couldnt i could not tell her it would have been too dark too dark altogether then marlow and his listeners were silent our first narrator explains nobody moved for a time we have lost the first of the ebb said the director suddenly i raised my head the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
Heretics of Dune,Frank Herbert,much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the god emperor sandworms have reappeared on arrakis now called rakis and renewed the flow of the all important spice melange to the galaxy with letos death a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great scattering a new civilization has risen with three dominant powers the ixians whose no ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection the bene tleilax who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of face dancers and the bene gesserit a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities however people from the scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers the most powerful of these forces are the honored matres a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men on rakis a girl called sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms the bene gesserit intends to use a tleilaxu provided duncan idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider and the religious forces of mankind who they know will ultimately worship her the sisterhood have subtly been altering the gholas to bring their physical reflexes up to modern standards the bene gesserit leader mother superior taraza brings miles teg to guard the new idaho taraza also sends reverend mother darwi odrade to take command of the bene gesserit keep on rakis odrade is a loose cannon she

starts training sheeana as a bene gesserit at about the same time an attempt is made on the life of idaho but teg is able to defeat it teg flees with duncan and lucilla into the countryside in an ancient harkonnen no globe teg proceeds to awaken idahos original memories but does so before lucilla can imprint duncan and thus tie him to the sisterhood in the meantime taraza has been searching for teg and his party and finally establishes contact during the operation however teg and his companions are ambushed teg is captured while lucilla and duncan escape teg is tortured by a t probe but under pressure discovers a new ability he is able to speed up his physical and mental reactions which enables him to escape at the same time idaho is ambushed and taken hostage taraza arranges a meeting with the tleilaxu master waff who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the honored matres when pressed on the issue of idaho he also admits that the bene tleilax have conditioned

meet waff again on rakis he tries to assassinate taraza but odrade convinces him that the sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the bene tleilax taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the scattering this agreement causes consternation among the bene gesserit but odrade realizes that tarazas plan is to destroy rakis by destroying the planet the bene gesserit would be dependent on the tleilaxu for the spice ensuring an alliance lucilla arrives at a bene gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by honored matres who have idaho as their captive as lucilla infiltrates it the young honored matre murbella proceeds to seduce the captured idaho with the honored matre imprinting method however hidden tleilaxu conditioning kicks in

presence they print fake bills for an escaped slave and later they paint him up entirely in blue and call him the sick arab on one occasion they arrive in a town and advertise a three night engagement of a play which they call the royal nonesuch the play turns out to be only a couple of minutes of hysterical cavorting not worth anywhere near the cents the townsmen were charged to see it on the afternoon of the first performance a drunk called boggs arrives in town and makes a nuisance of himself by going around threatening a southern gentleman by the name of colonel sherburn sherburn comes out and warns boggs that he can continue threatening him up until exactly one oclock at one oclock boggs continues and colonel sherburn kills him somebody in the crowd whom sherburn later identifies as buck harkness cries out that sherburn should be lynched they all head up to colonel sherburns gate where they are met by sherburn who is standing on his porch carrying a loaded shotgun and his three legged dalmatian he causes them to back down by making a defiant speech telling them about the essential cowardice of southern justice the only lynching to be done here says sherburn will be in the dark by men wearing masks by the third night of the royal nonesuch the townspeople are ready to take their revenge but the duke and the king have already skipped town and together with huck and jim they continue down the river once they are far enough away the two grifters test the next town and decide to impersonate two brothers of peter wilks a recently deceased man of property using an absurd english accent the king manages to convince nearly all the townspeople that he is one of the brothers a preacher just arrived from england while the duke pretends to be a deaf mute to match accounts of the other brother one man in town is certain that they are a fraud and confronts them on the matter but the crowd refuses to support him afterwards the duke out of fear suggests to the king that they should cut and run the king boldly states his intention to continue to liquidate wilks estate saying haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town huck likes wilks daughters who treat him with kindness and courtesy so he tries to thwart the grifters plans by stealing back the inheritance money when he is in danger of being discovered he has to hide it in wilks coffin which is buried the next morning without huck knowing whether the money has been found or not the arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion when none of their signatures match the one on record the deaf mute brother who is said to do the correspondence has his arm in a sling and cannot currently write the townspeople devise a test which requires digging up the coffin to check when the money is found in wilks coffin the duke and the king are able to escape in the confusion they manage to rejoin huck and jim on the raft to hucks despair since he had thought he had escaped them after the four fugitives have drifted far enough from the town the king takes advantage of hucks temporary absence to sell his interest in the escaped slave jim for forty dollars outraged by this betrayal huck rejects the advice of his conscience which continues to tell him that in helping jim escape to freedom he is stealing miss watsons property accepting that all right then ill go to hell huck resolves to free jim jim is being held at the plantation of silas and sally phelps in a surprise twist they are revealed to be tom sawyers aunt and uncle since tom is expected for a visit huck is mistaken for tom he plays along hoping to find jims location and free him when huck intercepts tom on the road and tells him

time the townspeople are ready for them the duke and king are captured by the townspeople and are tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail rather than simply sneaking jim out of the shed where he is being held tom develops an elaborate plan to free him involving secret messages hidden tunnels a rope ladder sent in jims food and other elements from popular novels including a note to the phelps warning them of a gang planning to steal their runaway slave during the resulting pursuit tom is shot in the leg jim remains with him rather than completing his escape risking recapture huck has long known jim was white on the inside although the doctor admires jims decency he betrays him to a passing skiff and jim is captured while sleeping and returned to the phelps family after jims recapture events quickly resolve themselves toms aunt polly arrives and reveals huck and toms true identities tom announces that jim is a free man miss watson died two months earlier and freed jim in her will but tom chose not to reveal jims freedom so he could come up with an elaborate plan to rescue jim jim tells huck that hucks father has been dead for some time he was the dead man they

for this voyage hunting down and killing moby dick an old very large sperm whale with a snow white hump and mottled skin that crippled ahab on his last whaling voyage only starbuck shows any sign of resistance to the charismatic but monomaniacal captain the first mate argues repeatedly that the ship s purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil with luck returning home profitably safely and quickly but not to seek out and kill moby dick in particular nbsp and especially not for revenge eventually even starbuck acquiesces to ahabs will though harboring misgivings the mystery of the dark figures seen before the pequod set sail is explained during the voyages first lowering for whales ahab has secretly brought along his own boat crew including a mysterious harpooneer named fedallah

their twin deaths the novel describes numerous gams social meetings of two ships on the open sea crews normally visit each other during a gam captains on one vessel and chief mates on the other mail

widespread destruction including the disappearance of fedallah on the third day moby dick rises up to reveal fedallahs corpse tied to him by harpoon ropes even after the initial battle on the third day it is clear that while ahab is a vengeful whale hunter moby dick while dangerous and fearless is not motivated to hunt humans as he swims away from the pequod starbuck exhorts ahab one last time to desist observing that ahab ignores this voice of reason and continues with his ill fated chase as the three boats sail out to hunt him moby dick damages two of them forcing them to go back to the ship and leaving only ahabs vessel intact ahab harpoons the whale but the harpoon line breaks moby dick then rams the pequod itself which begins to sink as ahab harpoons the whale again the unfolding harpoon line catches him around his neck and he is dragged into the depths of the sea by the diving moby dick the boat is caught up in the whirlpool of the sinking ship which takes almost all the crew to their deaths only ishmael survives clinging to queequeg s coffin turned life buoy for an entire day and night before the rachel rescues him

the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate sense net a street gang named the panther moderns are hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on sense net the diversion allows molly to penetrate the building and steal dixies rom case and molly continue to investigate armitage discovering his former identity of colonel willis corto corto was a member of operation screaming fist which planned on infiltrating and disrupting soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over russia the russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible but the military went ahead with screaming fist with a new secret purpose of testing these russian defenses as the operation team attacked a soviet computer center emp weapons shut down their computers and flight systems and corto and his men were targeted by soviet laser defenses he and a few survivors commandeered a soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded finnish border everyone was killed except corto who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by finnish defense forces attacking as they were landing the helicopter corto after some months in hospital is visited by a government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realise was fake testimony designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the emp weapons after the trials corto snaps killing the government official who contacted him and then disappears into the criminal underworld in istanbul the team recruits peter riviera an artist thief and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants although riviera is a sociopath armitage coerces him into joining the team the trail leads case and molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named wintermute created by the plutocratic tessier ashpool family who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside villa straylight a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of freeside a cylindrical space habitat located at l and functioning primarily as a las vegas style space resort for the wealthy wintermutes nature is finally revealed it is one half of a super ai entity planned by the family although its exact purpose is unknown the turing law code governing ais bans the construction of such entities to get around this it had to be built as two separate ais wintermute was programmed by the tessier ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half neuromancer unable to achieve this merger on its own wintermute recruited armitage and his team to help complete the goal case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the turing imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program at the same time riviera is to obtain the password to the turing lock from lady jane marie france tessier ashpool an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of tessier ashpool sa wintermute believes riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her and that she will give him the password the password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the tessier ashpool home in villa straylight and entered simultaneously as case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace otherwise the turing lock will remain intact armitages team attracts the attention of the turing police whose job is to prevent ais from exceeding their built in limitations as molly and riviera gain entrance to villa straylight three officers arrest case and take him into custody wintermute manipulates the orbital casinos security and maintenance systems and kills the officers allowing case to escape the armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the corto personality as he relives screaming fist it is revealed that in the past wintermute had originally contacted corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence eventually convincing corto that he was armitage wintermute used him to persuade case and molly to help it merge with its twin ai neuromancer finally armitage becomes the shattered corto again but his newfound personality is short lived as he is killed by wintermute inside villa straylight molly is captured by riviera and lady jane worried about molly and operating under orders from wintermute case tracks her down with help from maelcum his rastafarian pilot neuromancer attempts to trap case within a cyber construct where he finds the consciousness of linda lee his girlfriend from chiba city who was murdered by one of cases underworld contacts case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay freeing himself case takes maelcum and confronts lady jane riviera and hideo lady janes ninja bodyguard riviera tries to kill case but lady jane is sympathetic towards case and molly and hideo protects him riviera blinds hideo but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight molly then explains to case that riviera is doomed anyway as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs which she had spiked with lady jane in possession of the password the team makes it to the computer terminal case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target lady jane is induced to give up her password and the lock is opened wintermute unites with neuromancer fusing into a greater entity the poison in cases bloodstream is washed out and he and molly are handsomely paid for their efforts while pauleys rom construct is apparently erased at his own request in the epilogue molly leaves case case finds a new girlfriend resumes his hacking work and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use wintermute neuromancer contacts him saying that it has become the sum total of the works the whole show and has begun looking for other ais like itself scanning old recorded transmissions from the s the super ai finds a lone ai transmitting from the alpha centauri star system in the matrix case hears inhuman laughter a trait associated with pauley during cases work with his rom construct thus suggesting that pauley was not erased after all but instead worked out a side deal with wintermute neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix in the end while logged into the matrix case catches a glimpse of himself his dead girlfriend linda lee and neuromancer the implication of the sighting is that neuromancer created a copy of cases consciousness when it previously tried to trap him the copy of cases consciousness now exists with that of lindas in the matrix where they are together forever
Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,the action takes place in two periods the second world war and the late s during the internet boom in lawrence pritchard waterhouse a young u s navy code breaker and mathematical genius is assigned to the newly formed joint british and american detachment this ultra secret units role is to hide the fact that allied intelligence has cracked the german enigma code the detachment stages events often behind enemy lines that provide alternative explanations for the allied intelligence successes marine sergeant bobby shaftoe a veteran of china and guadalcanal serves in unit carrying out waterhouses plans at the same time japanese soldiers including mining engineer goto dengo an old friend of shaftoes are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission circa randy waterhouse lawrences grandson joins his old dungeons and dragons companion avi halaby in a new startup providing pinoy grams to migrant filipinos via new fiber optic cables the aptly named epiphyte corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional sultanate of kinakuta vietnam veteran doug shaftoe and his daughter amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by goto furudenendu heir apparent to goto engineering complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge
No Logo,Naomi Klein,the book comprises four sections no space no choice no jobs and no logo the first three deal with the negative effects of brand oriented corporate activity while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back the book begins by tracing the history of brands klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding there is an actual clothing brand nologo which has existed since the late s and can be seen at www nologo com this is an excellent example of this shift to an anti brand brand early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory produced products these slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles according to klein in response to an economic crash in the s latin american debt crisis black monday savings and loan crisis japanese asset price bubble corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and began to target the youth demographic as opposed to the baby boomers who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment the book discusses how brand names such as nike or pepsi expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere as this happened the brands obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered cool along the way the brands attempted to have their names associated with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements klein argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products this theme recurs in the book and klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in third world countries in such industries as clothing footwear and computer hardware this section also looks at ways in which brands have muscled their presence into the school system and how in doing so they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and have used their position to gather information about the students klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers in the second section klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public whether through market dominance wal mart or through aggressive invasion of a region starbucks klein argues that the goal of each company is to become the dominant force in its respective field meanwhile other corporations such as sony or disney simply open their own chains of stores preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves this section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image abc news for instance is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of disney its parent company other chains such as wal mart often threaten to pull various products off of their shelves forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands this might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with wal marts image of family friendliness also discussed is the way that corporations abuse copyright laws in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand in this section the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries and particularly to places known as export processing zones such zones have no labor laws leading to dire working conditions the book then shifts back to north america where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits the term mcjob is introduced defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation inflexible or undesirable hours little chance of advancement and high levels of stress meanwhile the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits all of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector the result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for this resentment along with rising unemployment labour abuses abroad disregard for the environment and the ever increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations the final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the s these include adbusters magazine and the culture jamming movement as well as reclaim the streets and the mclibel trial less radical protests are also discussed such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to sweatshop labour klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship opting for the latter when i started this book she writes i honestly didnt know whether i was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad based movement but as time went on what i clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes
The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Philip K. Dick,the story begins in a future world where global warming has resulted in global temperatures so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours in a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on earth the un has initiated a draft for colonizing the nearby planets where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug can d in concert with layouts layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonist in their marginal off world colonies or even earth where global warming has progressed to the point that antarctica is prime vacation resort territory the illegal drug can d allows people to share their experience of the perky pat the name of the main female character in the simulated world layouts this sharing has caused a pseudo religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug up to the point where the novel begins new york city based perky pat or p p layouts inc has held a monopoly on this product as well as on the illegal trade in the drug can d which makes the shared hallucinations possible the novel opens shortly after barney mayerson p p layouts top precognitive someone who can glimpse future possibilities and sort out the most likely to actually occur has received a draft notice from the un for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on mars mayerson is sleeping with his assistant roni fugate but remains conflicted about the divorce which he himself initiated from his first wife emily a ceramic pot artist meanwhile emilys second husband tries to sell her pot designs to p p layouts as possible accessories for the perky pat virtual worlds but barney recognizing them as emilys rejects them out of spite meanwhile the un rescues palmer eldritchs ship from a crash on pluto leo bulero head of p p layouts and an evolved human meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a german doctor which are supposed to push the client forward on an evolutionary scale and which result in gross physical as well as mental modifications hears rumors that eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the prox system with similar properties to can d and that he plans to market it as chew z with u n approval on off world colonies however chew z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of chew z even more addictive than can d has been this would effectively destroy p p layouts bulero tries to contact eldritch but he is quarantined at a u n hospital both mayerson and fugate have precognitions of reports that bulero is going to be responsible for murdering eldritch meanwhile emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy unfortunately emily begins to devolve rather than evolving this devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older less sophisticated designs from earlier work without realizing it under the guise of a reporter bulero travels to eldritchs estate on the moon where eldritch holds a press conference bulero is kidnapped and forced to take chew z intravenously he enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and eldritch seemingly have some control after wrangling about business with eldritch bulero travels to what appears to be earth at some time in the not too distant future evolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of eldritch an enemy of the sol system bulero returns to earth and fires mayerson because mayerson was afraid to travel to the moon to rescue him mayerson in despair accepts his un conscription to mars but bulero recruits him as a double agent mayerson is to inject himself with a virus after taking chew z in a plot to deceive the un into thinking chew z is harmful and cause them to ban it on mars mayerson buys some chew z from eldritch who appears in holographic form mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with emily but finds that he does not control his hallucination like bulero he finds himself in the future mayerson arrives in new york two years hence where he speaks with bulero fugate and his future self about the death of palmer eldritch he also encounters several manifestations of eldritch identifiable by their robotic right hand artificial eyes and steel teeth eldritch offers to help mayerson become whatever he wants but in fact is so manipulative and controlling of the chew z alternate reality that mayerson ultimately decides hed rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by eldritch when a despairing mayerson chooses death he finds himself apparently forced into eldritchs body right at the point in the timeline where bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at eldritchs ship it appears that eldritchs plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in mayersons body while allowing mayerson himself to die in eldritchs place eldritch meanwhile intends to live on in mayersons form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a martian colonist mayerson stuck in eldritchs body and mistaken for him is indeed nearly killed by bulero in the near future but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his chew z trance in the present by bulero who has just arrived on mars bulero is willing to take mayerson back to earth but refuses to after learning that mayerson did not inject himself with the virus mayerson is now confident that bulero will kill eldritch so the sacrifice of taking the virus in order to ruin eldritchs business is unnecessary but he does not try to convince bulero of this later mayerson discusses his experience with a neo christian colonist and they conclude that either eldritch became a god in the prox system or some god like being has taken his place mayerson is convinced some aspect of eldritch is still inside him and that as long as he refuses to take chew z again it is eldritch who will actually be killed by bulero in the near future mayerson is half resigned half hopeful about taking on the life of a martian colonist without reprieve mayerson considers the possibility of eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god but inimical or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god the novel has an ambiguous ending with bulero heading back toward earth and apparent proliferation of eldritchs cyborg bodily stigmata which may mean that bulero is still trapped in eldritchs hallucinatory domain or that chew z is becoming increasingly popular amongst terrans and martian colonists

Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead,Tom Stoppard,the play opens with rosencrantz and guildenstern betting on coin flips rosencrantz who bets heads each time wins ninety two flips in a row the extreme unlikeliness of this event according to the laws of probability leads guildenstern to suggest that they may be within un sub or supernatural forces the reader learns why they are where they are the king has sent for them guildenstern theorizes on the nature of reality focusing on how an event becomes increasingly real as more people witness it a troupe of tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show they seem capable only of performances involving bloodbaths the next two scenes are from the plot of hamlet the first involving hamlet and ophelia takes place off stage in the shakespeare the second is taken directly from hamlet and is rosencrantz and guildensterns first appearance in that play here the danish king and queen claudius and gertrude ask the two to discover the nature of hamlets recent madness the royal couple demonstrate an inability to distinguish the two courtiers from one another as indeed do the characters themselves to their irritation rosencrantz and guildenstern attempt to practice for their meeting with the prince by one pretending to be hamlet and the other asking him questions but they glean no new information from it the act closes with another scene from hamlet in which they finally meet the prince face to face the act opens with the end of the conversation between rosencrantz guildenstern and hamlet guildenstern tries to look on the bright side while rosencrantz makes it clear that the pair had made no progress that hamlet had entirely outwitted them the player returns to the stage he is angry that the pair had not earlier stayed to watch their play because without an audience his tragedians are nothing he tells them to stop questioning their existence because upon examination life appears too chaotic to comprehend the player rosencrantz and guildenstern lose themselves in yet another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language the player leaves in order to prepare for his production of the murder of gonzago set to be put on in front of hamlet and the king and queen the royal couple enters and begins another short scene taken directly from hamlet they ask about the duos encounter with the prince and rosencrantz and guildenstern inform them about his interest in the tragedians production after the king and queen leave the partners contemplate their job they see hamlet walk by but fail to seize the opportunity to interview him the tragedians return and perform their dress rehearsal of the murder of gonzago the play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in hamlet characters resembling rosencrantz and guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of english courtiers foreshadowing their true fate rosencrantz does not quite make the connection but guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the tragedians inability to capture the real essence of death the stage becomes dark when the stage is once again visible rosencrantz and guildenstern lie in the same position as had the actors portraying their deaths the partners are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple claudius enters again and tells them to find where hamlet has hidden polonius corpse after many false starts they eventually find hamlet who leaves with the king rosencrantz is delighted to find that his mission is complete but guildenstern knows it is not over hamlet enters speaking with a norwegian soldier rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany hamlet to england because it means freedom from the orders of the danish court guildenstern understands that wherever they go they are still trapped in this world rosencrantz and guildenstern find themselves on a ship that has already set sail the audience is led to believe that the pair has no knowledge of how they got there at first they try to determine whether they are still alive eventually they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat they remember that claudius had given them a letter to deliver to england after some brief confusion over who actually has the letter they find it and end up opening it they realize that claudius has asked for hamlet to be killed while rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings the stage becomes black and presumably the characters go to sleep hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself an act which takes place off stage in hamlet the pair discovers that the tragedians are hidden impossibly according to the stage directions in several barrels on deck they are fleeing denmark because their play has offended claudius when rosencrantz complains that there is not enough action pirates attack hamlet rosencrantz and guildenstern and the player all hide in separate barrels the lights dim when the lights come on again hamlet has vanished in hamlet its reported that he was kidnapped by pirates from the ship rosencrantz and guildenstern panic and re read the letter to find that it now calls for them to be put to death instead of the prince guildenstern cannot understand why he and rosencrantz are so important as to necessitate their executions the player tells guildenstern that all paths end in death guildenstern snaps and draws the players dagger from his belt shouting at him that his portrayals of death do not do justice to the real thing he stabs the player and the player appears to die guildenstern honestly believes he has killed the player seconds later the tragedians begin to clap and the player stands up and brushes himself off revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade the tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of hamlet the lighting shifts so that rosencrantz and guildenstern are the only ones visible rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die still he resigns himself to his fate and his character disappears guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he could have stopped the series of events that has brought him to this point he disappears as well the final scene features the last few lines from shakespeares hamlet the ambassador from england announces that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
Ringworld,Larry Niven,the novel opens in louis gridley wu is celebrating his th birthday despite his age louis is in perfect physical condition but is bored he has experienced life thoroughly and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of known space all alone in a spaceship for a year or more he is confronted by nessus a piersons puppeteer and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond known space speaker to animals speaker who is a kzin and teela brown a young human woman also join the voyage they first travel to the puppeteer home world where they learn that the expeditions goal is to explore a ringworld an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of earths orbit which makes it about million miles in circumference encircling a sol type star it rotates providing artificial gravity that is as strong as earths gravity through the action of centrifugal force the ringworld has a habitable flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million earth sized planets night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin ultra strong wire shadow square wire none of the crews attempts at contacting the ringworld succeed and their ship is disabled by its automated meteor defense system the severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow square wire and crash lands on the ringworld near a huge mountain the ships defences keep the crew compartment and many of the ships systems intact including the faster than light drive hyperdrive but the normal drive is destroyed leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive the team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space as well as fulfilling their original mission learning more about the ringworld using their flycycles they try to reach the rim of the ring where they hope to find some technology that will help them it will take them months to cross the vast distance when teela develops plateau trance they find themselves forced to land on the ground they encounter apparently human ringworld natives the natives who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city think that the crew are the engineers of the ring whom they revere as gods the crew is attacked when they commit a blasphemy they continue their journey during which nessus is forced to reveal some puppeteer secrets they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans breeding for luck and kzin breeding for less aggressiveness the resulting hostility forces nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance they encounter a city and in a floating building they find a map of the ringworld and videos of its past civilization in a giant storm caused by air escaping through a hole in the ring floor due to meteor impact teela is blown away in an unknown direction while searching for her in a ruined city louis and speakers flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders they are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station nessus arrives entering the station to help his team in the station they meet halrloprillalar hotrufan prill a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the ringworld and other inhabited worlds her spaceship was stranded on the ringworld when the landing mechanism failed she relates what she learned of the downfall of the ringworlds civilization a mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship without its superconductive technology civilization fell teela reaches the police station accompanied by her new lover a native hero called seeker who helped her survive based on his studies of an ancient ringworld map louis devises a plan to escape the four explorers with seeker and prill use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers crashed ship along the way teela and seeker choose to remain behind to inhabit a flying castle and remain on ringworld the remaining explorers and prill collect one end of the shadow square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed dragging the wire behind them as they travel reaching the wreck louis threads the shadow wire through the crashed ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station and then continues to pull the wire onward up to the summit of fist of god the enormous mountain near their crash site the massive mountain does not appear on a map of the original ringworld leading louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteor impact with the underside of the ring which pushed the mountain up from the ring floor and broke through the top of the mountain above the edge of the rings atmosphere is therefore a passage to the underside of the ringworld and freedom louis drives the police station over the edge of the crater because the ringworld spins fast enough to provide gravity once the police station and ship are on the underside centrifugal force pushes them outward from the ring into open space the crew can then use the ships faster than light drive to get home the book concludes with louis and speaker discussing returning to the ringworld
Rendezvous with Rama,Arthur C. Clarke,after a major disaster caused by a meteorite falling in eastern italy in the government of earth sets up the spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space the rama of the title is an alien star ship initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as it is detected by astronomers in the year while still outside the orbit of jupiter the objects speed nbsp nbsp km h and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate that this is not an object on a long orbit around our sun it comes from interstellar space astronomers interest is further piqued when they realise that this asteroid not only has an extremely rapid rotation period of minutes but it is exceptionally large it is subsequently renamed rama after the hindu god and an unmanned space probe dubbed sita is launched from the mars moon phobos to intercept and photograph the object the resulting images taken during its rapid flyby reveal that rama is a perfect cylinder in diameter and long made of a completely featureless material making this humankinds first encounter with an alien space ship the manned solar survey vessel endeavour is sent to study rama as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period rama will spend in our solar system endeavour manages to rendezvous with rama one month after the space ship first comes to earths attention when the giant alien spacecraft is already within venus orbit the crew led by commander bill norton enters rama through triple airlocks and explores the vast km wide by km long cylindrical world of its interior but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remains enigmatic throughout the book inside rama the air is discovered to be breathable the astronauts discover several features including cities odd blocky shapes that look like buildings and streets with shallow trenches in them looking like trolley car tracks that actually served as factories a sea that stretches in a band around rama dubbed the cylindrical sea and seven massive cones at the southern end of rama believed to form part of the propulsion system one of the crew members jimmy pak who has experience with low gravity skybikes volunteers to ride a smuggled skybike along ramas axis to the far end otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the m high cliff on the opposite shore a few hours later jimmy reaches the massive metal cones on the southern end of rama picking up a strange magnetic field coming from the cones pak takes a few pictures of the area and the strange plateau on the southern end of ramas landmass before leaving the electrical charge in the atmosphere begins to increase during paks return resulting in lightning a discharge hits his skybike causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent when pak wakes up he sees a crab like creature picking up his skybike and chopping it into pieces he cannot decide whether it is a robot or a biological alien and keeps his distance while contacting norton and the others on the other side of rama for help norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea using a small improvised craft and pak waits he sees the crab like creature dump the remains of the skybike into the sea and he approaches the creature but it completely ignores him pak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea amongst the strange geometric patterns he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research pak jumps off the m cliff his descent slowed by low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute and swims quickly to the craft the ride back is highlighted by tidal waves in the cylindrical sea formed by movements of rama itself as it makes course corrections when the crew arrive at base they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp when one is found damaged and apparently lifeless the teams doctor biologist surgeon commander laura ernst inspects it and names it a biot or a hybrid of a biological entity and robot she concludes that it and others appear to be electrically powered by natural internal batteries much like terrestrial electric eels and possess some degree of intelligence they are believed to be the servants of ramas still absent builders and maintainers of the starship the members of the rama committee and the united planets both based on the moon have been monitoring events inside rama and giving feedback the hermian colonists have concluded that rama is a potential threat to them and send a rocket mounted bomb to destroy rama it is successfully defused by lt boris rodrigo using a pair of wire cutters as rama approaches perihelion the biots act strangely jumping into the cylindrical sea where they are destroyed by aquatic biots sharks and absorbed back into the mineral laden water on one last expedition to explore rama a few crew members decide to visit the city london chosen as closest to the stairways at the northern end of the cylinder they use to return to their ship to use a laser to cut open one of the buildings and see what is inside inside they discover pedestals containing holograms of various artifacts believed to have been used by the ramans as tools and other objects the holograms themselves are presumed to be templates for replicating these items as needed the most amazing sight is what appears to be a uniform with bandoliers straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the ramans but before the crew can photograph any more holograms the lights start going out and they must leave they all exit up through the stairway on ramas northern side out of the three airlocks and board endeavour when endeavour is a safe distance away and rama reaches perihelion rama harnesses the suns gravitational field with its mysterious space drive for use in a slingshot manoeuvre and is flung out of the solar system toward an unknown location in the direction of the large magellanic cloud the book was meant to stand alone although the final sentence of the book suggests otherwise clarke however denied that this sentence was meant to hint at a continuation of the story according to his foreword in the books sequel it was just a good way to end the book and was added during a final revision

Speaker for the Dead,Orson Scott Card,on novinhas request for a speaker andrew wiggin leaves for lusitania a colony turned into a virtual prison with its expansion severely limited and its whole existence devoted to the work of xenologers who study the pequeninos the first sentient beings found since the destruction of formics lusitania itself is remarkably lacking in biodiversity featuring thousands of unfilled ecological niches the other outstanding feature of lusitania is the descolada a native virus which almost wipes out the colony until husband and wife biologists gusta and cida succeed in developing counters unfortunately they didnt find the cure soon enough to save themselves leaving orphaned daughter novinha to strike out for herself at the age of thirteen novinha a cold and distant girl successfully petitions to be made the official biologist of the colony roughly the equivalent of a masters degree from then on she contributes to the work of father and son xenologers alien anthropology pipo and libo and for a short time there is family and camaraderie one day however she makes a discovery about the descolada that its in every native lifeform and pipo rushes out to talk to the piggies about the discovery without telling her or libo why its important they cant figure it out on their own and never learn a few hours later pipo is found vivisected in the grass his corpse does not even have the benefit of a tree the symbol of honor placed among all dead piggies novinha erases all the lab work but cannot delete the information itself due to regulations libo demands to see it but even their love for each other will not make her let him see it it appears to be a secret the piggies will kill to keep now novinha is determined to ensure they never marry the way they always planned to for if they do libo will have access to those locked files and novinha fears will share the same fate as his father in anguish novinha calls for a speaker for the dead hoping beyond hope that perhaps the original speaker may arrive to make sense of pipos death and maybe of her life andrew wiggin doesnt dare let himself be known as ender anymore the name is now an epithet ender decides to leave his sister valentine behind she is married and pregnant after traveling with her for many years he leaves as soon as possible with his only companion being jane an artificial sentience existing within the ansible computer network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances he arrives on lusitania after twenty two years in transit only around two weeks to him to discover that novinha has canceled her call or rather tried to as a call for a speaker cannot legally be canceled after the speaker has begun the journey however two others have called making enders trip not entirely in vain they are novinhas eldest son miro calling for someone to speak the death of libo who was killed the same way his father was and novinhas eldest daughter ela calling for someone to speak the death of novinhas husband marcos ribeira who died not six weeks ago from a terminal disease besides attempting to unravel the question of why novinha married marc o when she really loved libo marc o was sterile and a quick genetic scan on janes part reveals that novinhas children are all in fact libos ender also takes responsibility for attempting to heal the ribeira family and manages to adopt or perhaps is adopted by most of the children within their first meeting he also takes a strong interest in the pequeninos and eventually in direct violation of starways congress law meets with them in person the hive queen has also managed to make contact with the pequeninos philotically and has told them a number of things mdash including the fact that andrew wiggin is not only the original speaker for the dead but the original xenocide as well which romantically involved zenadors a shortened form of the word xenologists miro and ouanda do not believe the hive queen very emphatically wants to be revived and freed on lusitania finally in an effort to help ender jane deliberately reveals to starways congress that miro and ouanda continuing the legacy of ouandas dead father libo have been deliberately introducing new technology into the piggy lifestyle both zenadors are called away to the nearest world for trial a journey that would take twenty two years the colonys charter is revoked and all humans are ordered to evacuate posthaste leaving no sign of ever having been there ender holds a public speaking for marc o novinhas late husband however ender cannot but help reveal secrets from the lives of libo pipo and even novinha herself as their lives were all so delicately bound together by guilt deception and love the speaker explains how novinha blames herself for pipos death and underwent a life of suffering and deception marrying marc o so that to prevent libo from accessing the information which killed pipo but secretly trysting with libo because their love for each other never truly died the meaning of pipos and libos murders come out as well the trees are the third stage in the life of the piggies trees grown from piggies killed normally become brothertrees but the ritually dissected ones are done so in order to make them fathertrees sentient living trees that are unlike animal pequeninos capable of reproduction the descolada is proved to be instrumental in these transformations finally the speaker for the dead is able to work out a treaty with the piggies so that humans and pequeninos might live in peace unfortunately it is not without cost miro distraught to learn that ouanda his girlfriend in secret is actually his sister attempts to cross the fence which separates the humans from the piggies and suffers significant neurological damage with no other way to save him the colony declares itself in rebellion jane shuts off outside ansible contact miro is rescued and ender enters the forest to negotiate the aforementioned treaty he signs it ender wiggin and for the first time in his life someone novinha is prepared to receive the xenocide with compassion instead of revulsion valentine and her family plan to come to lusitania to help out in the rebellion aided by jane miro with his crippled body is sent into space to meet them the hive queen is released ready to begin the continuation of her species and ender marries novinha

planet destroy their targets and retreat suffering a single casualty in the process dizzy flores who dies in the retrieval boat of wounds received in action the story then flashes back to ricos graduation from high school and his decision to sign up for federal service over the objections of his father who disowns him this is the only chapter that describes ricos civilian life and most of it

federation some see dubois as speaking for heinlein throughout the novel he delivers what is probably the books most famous soliloquy on violence it has settled more issues in history than has any other factor fleet sergeant hos monologues examine the nature of military service and his anti military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with dubois we learn later that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to ricos high school history and moral philosophy course which describe how in the terran federation of ricos day the rights of a full citizen to vote and hold public office must be earned through some form of volunteer federal service those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this federal service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy free speech assembly etc but they cannot vote or hold public office this structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the th century western democracies brought on by both social failures at home among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency and military defeat by the chinese hegemony overseas in the next section of the novel after being denied all his higher preferred service choices rico goes to boot camp at camp arthur currie on the northern prairies five chapters are spent exploring ricos experience there including his adjustment to a very different situation entering the service under the training of the leading instructor career ships sergeant charles zim camp currie is rigorous by design less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training the rest either resign are expelled or die in training one of the chapters deals with ted hendrick a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a simulated combat exercise he caught sgt zim by surprise after being struck by the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise another recruit a deserter who murdered a baby girl while awol is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police and return to camp

during ricos training the bug war has changed from border incidents to formal war and rico finds himself taking part in combat operations the war officially starts with an arachnid attack that annihilates the city of buenos aires which kills juans mother who was visiting there although rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there had been many incidents patrols or police actions rico briefly describes the terran federations loss at the battle of klendathu during which his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed following klendathu the terran federation is reduced to making hit and run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel which chronologically would be placed between chapters and rico meanwhile finds himself posted to rasczaks roughnecks this part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life as well as the relationship between officers and non commissioned officers personified in this case by rasczak and sergeant jelal eventually rico decides to become a career soldier and one of his fellow troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for officer candidate school he applies and is accepted it turns out to be just like boot camp only squared and cubed with books added rico manages to make it through to the final exam in the fleet he is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his field test and commands his own unit during operation royalty it is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor sergeant zim although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men he passes the final exam and graduates as a second lieutenant there is also an account of the meeting between rico and his father who volunteered for service after his wife ricos mother was killed at buenos aires the final chapter serves as more of a coda depicting rico aboard the rodger young as the lieutenant in command of ricos

The Doors of Perception,Aldous Huxley,after a brief overview of research into mescaline huxley recounts that he was given of a gram at am one day in may huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly colored visionary landscapes when he only sees lights and shapes he puts this down to being a bad visualiser however he experiences a great change in his perception of the external world by pm a vase of flowers becomes the miracle moment by moment of naked existence the experience he asserts is neither agreeable nor disagreeable but simply is he likens it to meister eckhart s istigheit or is ness and plato s being but not separated from becoming he feels he understands the hindu concept of satchitananda as well as the zen koan that the dharma body of the buddha is in the hedge and buddhist suchness in this state huxley explains he didn t have an i but instead a not i meaning and existence pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time duration is replaced by a perpetual present reflecting on the experience afterwards huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher c d broad that to enable us to live the brain and nervous system eliminate unessential information from the totality of the mind at large in summary huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of mescaline visual impressions are intensified and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating temporarily leaving the chronological flow he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the world s biggest drug store wbds where he was presented with books on art in one book the dress in botticelli s judith provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art to create mood and also to represent the mystery of pure being huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people c zanne s self portrait with a straw hat seems to him as incredibly pretentious while vermeer s human still lives also the le nain brothers and vuillard are the nearest to reflecting this not self state for huxley the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life known as the way of martha and the way of mary as huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height but not its fullness correct behaviour and alertness are needed nonetheless huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world after listening to mozart s c minor piano concerto gesualdo s madrigals and alban berg s lyric suite huxley heads into the garden outside the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed this gives him an insight into madness he reflects that spiritual literature including the works of jacob boehme william law and the tibetan book of the dead talk of these pains and terrors huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential after lunch and the drive to the wbds he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind his final insight is taken from buddhist scripture that within sameness there is difference although that difference is not different from sameness the book finishes with huxley s final reflections on the meaning of his experience firstly the urge to transcend one s self is universal through times and cultures and was characterized by h g wells as the door in the wall he reasons that better healthier doors are needed than alcohol and tobacco mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions ideally self transcendence would be found in religion but huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen christianity and mescaline seem well suited for each other the native american church for instance uses the drug as a sacrament where its use combines religious feeling with decorum huxley concludes that mescaline is not enlightenment or the beatific vision but a gratuitous grace a term taken from st thomas aquinas summa theologica it is not necessary but helpful especially so for the intellectual who can become the victim of words and symbols although systematic reasoning is important direct perception has intrinsic value too finally huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better
The Time Machine,H. G. Wells,the books protagonist is an english scientist and gentleman inventor living in richmond surrey identified by a narrator simply as the time traveller the narrator recounts the travellers lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it he reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale becoming the new narrator in the new narrative the time traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to a d where he meets the eloi a society of small elegant childlike adults they live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings doing no work and having a frugivorous diet his efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline and he speculates that they are a peaceful communist society the result of humanity conquering nature with technology and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival returning to the site where he arrived the time traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors locked from the inside which resembles a sphinx later in the dark he is approached menacingly by the morlocks ape like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above ground paradise possible he alters his theory speculating that the human race has evolved into two species the leisured classes have become the ineffectual eloi and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutish light fearing morlocks deducing that the morlocks have taken his time machine he explores the morlock tunnels learning that they feed on the eloi his revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers the time traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger with no real challenges facing either species they have both lost the spirit intelligence and physical fitness of man at its peak meanwhile he saves an eloi named weena from drowning as none of the other eloi take any notice of her plight and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days he takes weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against morlocks whom he fears he must fight to get back his machine he plans to take weena back to his own time because the long and tiring journey back to weenas home is too much for them they stop in the forest and they are then overcome by morlocks in the night and weena faints the traveller escapes only when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire weena is presumably lost in the fire as are the morlocks the morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the traveller not understanding that he will use it to escape he travels further ahead to roughly million years from his own time there he sees some of the last living things on a dying earth menacing reddish crab like creatures slowly wandering the blood red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation he continues to make short jumps through time seeing earths rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger redder and dimmer and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out overwhelmed he returns to his laboratory arriving just three hours after he originally left interrupting dinner he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors producing as evidence two strange flowers weena had put in his pocket the original narrator takes over and relates that he returned to the time travellers house the next day finding him in final preparations for another journey the traveller promises to return in half an hour but three years later the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him
The Shockwave Rider,John Brunner,the novel is set in the weeks following nicks recapture after several years on the run alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator who is trying to discover why the programs star pupil had absconded and flashbacks of his career the interrogator is paul freeman a graduate of another secret installation known as electric skillet which focuses on weapons and defense strategy although he initially felt at home at tarnover nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there these produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study at this point nick becomes determined to escape he studies data processing steals a personal id code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance and goes on the run he uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself easily adopting entire new personas one is the pastor of a popular church another is an idle playboy gigolo in this last role calling himself sandy locke he becomes the lover of ina grierson a top executive at ground to space industries a powerful hypercorp known to all as g s intending to use the computer facilities at g s to ensure that his code is still valid after the six years he has been away he signs on as a systems rationalizer with the company this brings him into contact with inas daughter kate who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle at the age of nicks age when he left tarnover kate is a perpetual student at umkc she is perceptive enough to penetrate nicks adopted persona deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him he visits her at home helping her to clean out some of her possessions and meeting her tame cougar bagheera bagheera is the product of her late fathers genetic research into intelligence he died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses the st century lifestyle produces a symptom called overload in many people and most including nick take tranquilizers to some degree however nick collapses completely when told that a representative from tarnover is coming to meet him at g s he returns to kate and confesses that he is not what he seems asking for her help she conducts him to one of the paid avoidance areas in california where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake after nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places they move to the least known one a town called precipice precipice turns out to be a utopian community of a few thousand people the nearest comparison would be an agrarian cottage industry community designed by william morris precipice is also the home of hearing aid an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country hearing aid is also known as the ten nines after the phone number used to call it people call the service and simply talk some rant others seek sympathy still others commit suicide while on the phone hearing aids promise is that nobody else not even the government will hear the call the only response hearing aid gives to a caller is only i heard that i hope it helped nick and kate settle into the community the inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that kates father worked on these act as companions guards nannies and even lie detectors using their sense of smell nick rewrites the computer tapeworm that prevents the calls to hearing aid being monitored while at g s he became aware of massive backups of data being performed clearly in anticipation of a major network outage the hearing aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked but nick realizes that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them his new worm which he calls a phage cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network possibly encouraged by the government local gangs and tribes raid precipice burning down nick and kates house before being overwhelmed by the dogs nick suffering another overload blames kate for the incident since she following hearing aid policy cut off a call from someone attempting to warn precipice he hits her and then filled with remorse leaves the town he finally reveals his location to the authorities when encountering one of the roman circus operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country he responds to an all comers challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience at tarnover paul freeman takes charge of the interrogation he was the representative whom nick as sandy locke was supposed to meet at g s freeman a tall gaunt african american gradually comes to realize that he has more sympathy with nicks views than his employers and eventually absconds himself giving nick computer access so that nick can make his own escape the precipitating event in this case is kates abduction by government agents who bring her to tarnover for further questioning and to threaten nick with the code he gets from freeman he sets up an identity as an army major with kate as his prisoner once clear of tarnover they disappear together this time around nick has another plan and rather than running and hiding he and kate spend a number of months traveling the country aided by an invisible college of academics who are allies or former residents of precipice he creates a new worm which is designed to destroy all secrecy brunner invented the term worm for this program as a self replicating program that propagates across a computer network the term worm was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program the worm is eventually activated and the details of all the governments dark secrets clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children bribes and kickbacks from corporations concealed crimes of high public officials now become accessible from anywhere on the network in fact those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details in place of the old system nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism with peoples worth being defined by their roles in society not their connections in high places in effect the network becomes the entire government and financial system policing income for illegal money freezing the accounts of criminals while making sure money or credit flows to places where people are in need this will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite again conducted over the network allow it in a final atavistic attempt at revenge the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local air force base warned by hearing aid nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town the book

The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,sir charles baskerville is found lying dead on the grounds of his country house baskerville hall the cause is ascribed to a heart attack fearing for the safety of sir charless nephew and only known heir sir henry baskerville coming from america to claim his inheritance dr james mortimer travels to london and asks sherlock holmes for help mortimer explains that the baskerville family is afflicted by a curse according to an old account over two centuries ago hugo baskerville was infatuated with a farmers daughter he kidnapped her and imprisoned her in his bedroom she escaped and the furious baskerville offered his soul to the devil if he could recapture her aided by friends he pursued the girl onto the desolate moor baskerville and his victim were found dead she had died from fright but a giant spectral hound stood guard over baskervilles body the hound tore out baskervilles throat then vanished into the night sir charles baskerville had become fearful of the legendary curse and its hellhound mortimer decided that sir charles had been waiting for someone when he died his face was contorted in a ghastly expression while his footprints suggested he was running from something the elderly mans heart was not strong and he had planned to go to london the next day mortimer says he had seen the footprints of a gigantic hound near sir charless body something not revealed at the inquest intrigued by the case holmes meets with sir henry newly arrived from america sir henry is puzzled by an anonymous note delivered to his london hotel room warning him to avoid the devon moors holmes says that the note had been composed largely of letters cut from the times probably in a hotel judging by other clues the fact that the letters were cut with nail scissors suggested an authoress as did a remnant whiff of perfume holmes keeps this last detail to himself when holmes and watson later join sir henry at his hotel they learn one of the baronets new boots has gone missing no good explanation can be found for the loss holmes asks if there were any other living relatives besides sir henry mortimer tells him that charles had two brothers rodger and john sir henry is the sole child of john who settled in america and raised his son there another brother rodger was known to be the black sheep of the family a wastrel and inveterate gambler he fled to south america to avoid creditors he is believed to have died there alone despite the notes warning sir henry insists on visiting baskerville hall as sir henry leaves holmes baker street apartment holmes and doctor watson follow him they realise that a man with a fake looking black beard in a cab is also following him holmes and watson pursue this man but he escapes however holmes memorises the cab number holmes stops in at a messenger office and employs a young boy cartwright to go visit londons hotels and look through wastepaper in search of cut up copies of the times by the time they return to the hotel sir henry has had another newer boot stolen when the first missing boot is discovered before the meeting is over holmes begins to realise they must be dealing with a real hound hence the emphasis on the scent of the used boot when conversation turns to the man in the cab mortimer says that barrymore the servant at baskerville hall has a beard and a telegram is sent to check on his whereabouts it is decided that with holmes being tied up in london with other cases watson will accompany sir henry to baskerville hall and report back by telegram in detail later that evening telegrams from cartwright who was unable to find the newspaper and baskerville hall where barrymore apparently is bring an end to those leads a visit from john clayton who was driving the cab with the black bearded man is of little help he says that the man had identified himself as holmes much to the surprise and amusement of the actual holmes mortimer watson and sir henry set off for baskerville hall the following saturday the baronet is excited to see it and his connection with the land is clear but finds the moor dampened soldiers are about the area on the lookout for an escaped murderer named selden barrymore and his wife wish to depart baskerville hall as soon as is convenient and the hall is in general a somber place watson has trouble sleeping that night and hears a woman crying the next morning barrymore denies that it was his wife who is one of only two women in the house watson sees mrs barrymore later in the morning however and observes clear evidence that she has indeed been weeping watson checks with the postmaster in coombe tracey and learns that the telegram was not actually delivered into the hands of barrymore so it is no longer certain that he was at the hall and not in london on his way back watson meets jack stapleton a naturalist familiar with the moor even though he has only been in the area for two years they hear a moan that the peasants attribute to the hound but stapleton attributes it to the cry of a bittern or possibly the bog settling he then runs off after a specimen of the butterfly cyclopedes which was still found on dartmoor until the s watson is not alone for long before beryl stapleton jacks sister approaches him mistaking him for sir henry she urgently warns him to leave the area but drops the subject when her brother returns the three walk to merripit house the stapletons home and during the discussion watson learns that stapleton used to run a school in yorkshire though he is offered lunch and a look at stapleton s collections watson departs for the hall before he gets far along the path miss stapleton overtakes him and retracts her warning watson notices that the brother and sister dont look very much alike sir henry soon meets miss stapleton and becomes romantically interested despite her brother s intrusions watson meets another neighbour mr frankland an elderly lawyer barrymore draws increasing suspicion as watson and sir henry see him late at night walk with a candle into an empty room hold it up to the window and then leave realising that the room has a view out on the moor watson and sir henry determine to figure out what is going on barrymores wife confesses that her brother is selden the escaped murderer and that she was giving him food while he was out on the moor meanwhile during the day sir henry continues to pursue beryl stapleton until her brother runs up on them and yells angrily he later explains to the disappointed baronet that it was not personal he was just afraid of losing his only companion so quickly to show there are no hard feelings he invites sir henry to dine with him and his sister on friday sir henry then becomes the person doing the surprising when he and watson walk in on barrymore catching him at night in the room with a candle barrymore refuses to answer their questions since it is not his secret to tell but mrs barrymore s she tells them that the runaway convict selden is her brother and the candle is a signal to him that food has been left for him when the couple return to their room sir henry and watson go off to find the convict despite the poor weather and frightening sound of the hound they see selden by another candle but are unable to catch him watson notices the outlined figure of another man standing on top of a tor with the moon behind him but he likewise gets away barrymore is upset when he finds out that they tried to capture selden but when an agreement is reached to allow selden to flee the country he is willing to repay the favour he tells them of finding a mostly burnt letter asking sir charles to be at the gate at the time of his death it was signed with the initials l l mortimer tells watson the next day those initials could stand for laura lyons frankland s daughter she lives in coombe tracey when watson goes to talk to her she admits to writing the letter in hopes that sir charles would be willing to help finance her divorce but says she never kept the appointment frankland has just won two law cases and invites watson in to help him celebrate barrymore had previously told watson that another man lived out on the moor besides selden and frankland unwittingly confirms this when he shows watson through his telescope the figure of a boy carrying food watson departs the house and goes in that direction he finds the prehistoric stone dwelling where the unknown man has been staying goes in and sees a message reporting on his own activities he waits revolver at the ready for the unknown man to return the unknown man proves to be holmes he has kept his location a secret so that watson would not be tempted to come out and so he would be able to appear on the scene of action at the critical moment watson s reports have been of much help to him and he then tells his friend some of the information he has uncoveredstapleton is actually married to the woman passing as miss stapleton and was also promising marriage to laura lyons to get her cooperation as they bring their conversation to an end they hear a ghastly scream they run towards the sound and finding a body mistake it for sir henry they realise it is actually the escaped convict selden the brother of mrs barrymore dressed in the baronet s old clothes which had been given to barrymore by way of further apology for distrusting him then stapleton appears and while he makes excuses for his presence holmes announces that he will return to london the next day his investigations having produced no result holmes and watson return to baskerville hall where over dinner the detective stares at hugo baskervilles portrait calling watson over after dinner he covers the hair to show the face revealing its striking likeness to stapleton this provides the motive in the crimewith sir henry gone stapleton could lay claim to the baskerville fortune being clearly a baskerville himself when they return to mrs lyons s apartment holmes questioning forces her to admit stapleton s role in the letter that lured sir charles to his death they go to the railway station to meet det inspector lestrade whom holmes has called in by telegram under the threat of advancing fog watson holmes and lestrade lie in wait outside merripit house where sir henry has been dining when the baronet leaves and sets off across the moor stapleton looses the hound holmes and watson manage to shoot it before it can hurt sir henry seriously and discover that its hellish appearance was acquired by means of phosphorus they find mrs stapleton bound and gagged in an upstairs room of merripit house when she is freed she tells them of stapleton s hideout an island deep in the great grimpen mire they look for him next day unsuccessfully and he is presumed dead having lost his footing and being sucked down into the foul and bottomless depths of the mire holmes and watson are only able to find and recover sir henrys boot used by stapleton to give the hound sir henrys scent and find the remains of dr mortimers dog in the mire some weeks later watson questions holmes about the baskerville case holmes reveals that although believed to have died unmarried sir charles younger brother rodger baskerville had married and had a son with the same name as his father the son john rodger baskerville after embezzling public money in costa rica took the name vandeleur and fled to england where he used the money to fund a yorkshire school unfortunately for him the tutor he had hired died of consumption and after an epidemic of the disease killed three students the school itself failed now using the name stapleton baskerville vandeleur fled with his wife to dartmoor he apparently supported himself by burglary engaging in four large robberies and pistolling a page who surprised him having learned the story of the hound he resolved to kill off the remaining baskervilles so that he could come into the inheritance as the last of the line he had no interest in the estate and simply wanted the inheritance money he purchased the hound and hid it in the mire at the site of an abandoned tin mine on the night of his death sir charles had been waiting for laura lyons the cigar ash at the scene the ash had twice dropped from his cigar showed he had waited for some time instead he met the hound that had been trained by stapleton and covered with phosphorus to give it an unearthly appearance sir charles ran for his life but then had the fatal heart attack which killed him since dogs do not eat or bite dead bodies it left him there untouched stapleton followed sir henry in london and also stole his new boot but later returned it since it had not been worn and thus lacked sir henrys scent holmes speculated that the hotel bootblack had been bribed to steal an old boot of henrys instead the hound pursued selden to his death in a fall because he was wearing sir henrys old clothes on the night the hound attacked sir henry stapletons wife had refused to have any further part in stapletons plot but her abusive husband beat and tied her to a pole to prevent her from warning him in holmes words he stapleton has for years been a desperate and dangerous man it was his consuming interest in entomology that allowed holmes to identify him as the same man as vandeleur the former schoolmaster

bloodless meanwhile during a joint military exercise japanese ships accidentally launch torpedoes at the u s pacific fleet destroying two submarines and crippling two aircraft carriers this drastically reduces the u s capability to project power into the western pacific an immediate retaliation is forestalled by the second phase of the japanese offensive an economic attack even as the military offensive begins japan engineers the collapse of the u s stock market by hiring a programmer in an exchange firm to insert a logic bomb into the system which ends up deleting all trade records the japanese also attempt to assassinate the chairman of the federal reserve but their target survives the attempt with a broken back with a massive economic crisis and subsequent mass panic the japanese hope that america will be too distracted to quickly respond to japans military actions japan immediately sues for peace offering international talks and seemingly free elections in the marianas to delay a u s response negotiators secretly reveal to the u s that japan has obtained nuclear ballistic missile capability the japanese oligarchs led by yamata believe that offers of negotiation and the nuclear deterrent defended by a seemingly impregnable awacs system will cause the u s to concede japans advantage with two of americas twelve carriers disabled and the rest pinned down by international crises elsewhere ryan has few resources with which to defend american interests despite his typical focus on military issues ryan advises president durling to deal with the economic crisis first ryan also realizes that japans deletion of trade records could be an advantage in responding to the economic threat he engineers a do over where all of the transactions on the day of the mass deletion are ignored and all assets are restored to their state at the start of business that day accompanied by a presidential address to the nation and behind the scenes bullying of investment banks the plan is a success americas economy is restored with only minor disruption ryan eliminates japans awacs system through a series of accidents using widely dispersed u s assets allowing b bombers to destroy the silos clark and chavez blind incoming japanese pilots with a laser and cause them to crash on landing and rescue japans moderate former prime minister an army special operations team is airdropped into japan to support comanche helicopters in attacking the other awacs planes and kill members of yamatas cabal meanwhile admiral robby jackson liberates the marianas with little bloodshed cornered japans current prime minister resigns ceding power to his predecessor yamata is arrested and the new japanese government accepts americas generous offer of status quo ante throughout the book president durling faces another less important political crisis vice president ed kealty is forced to resign after being accused of drugging and raping a former member of his staff with the crisis over president durling nominates ryan as vice president during a joint session of congress however an embittered japan air lines pilot driven mad by the deaths of his son and brother during the previous conflict flies his boeing directly into the u s capitol nearly the entire presidential line of succession is eliminated ryan who had just been confirmed as vice president moments before narrowly escapes the attack and is immediately sworn in as president
Tunnel in the Sky,Robert A. Heinlein,a malthusian catastrophe on earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation called the ramsbotham jump which is used to send earths excess population to colonize other planets however the costs of operating the device mean that the colonies are isolated from earth until they can justify two way travel because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure more primitive methods are employed for example horses instead of tractors because tractors cannot reproduce themselves rod walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a professional colonist the final test of his advanced survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry but are otherwise completely on their own they are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable on test day each student walks through the ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet though reasonably close to the pickup point rod acting on advice chooses to equip himself with hunting knives and basic survival gear rather than high tech weaponry on the grounds that the latter is dependent on the infrastructure required to maintain it and can easily become a crutch the last advice the students receive is to watch out for stobor on the second day rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief when he wakes up all he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage in his desperate concentration on survival he loses track of time eventually he teams up with jacqueline jack daudet a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male when she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact he realizes that they are stranded they start recruiting others for the long haul and rod becomes the de facto leader of a community that eventually grows to around people rod has no taste for politics or administration and is happy to have grant cowper an older college student and born politician elected mayor grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done despite disagreeing with many of grants policies rod supports him grant ignores rods warning that they are living in a dangerously hard to defend location and that they should move to a cave system he has found when a species previously thought harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through their camp the settlement is devastated and grant is killed rod is subsequently put back in charge heinlein tracks the social development of this community of educated westerners deprived of technology followed by its abrupt dissolution when contact with earth is reestablished after nearly two years of isolation the culture shock experienced by the survivors highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult by reversing the process abruptly each of the students goes from being a personally self responsible member of an autonomous community back to being a youth with little authority or responsibility in the home culture all of the students go back willingly except for rod who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small but sovereign state to a teenager casually brushed aside by the adult rescuers however his teacher and now brother in law and his sister persuade him to change his mind his teacher also informs rod that his warning against stobor robots spelled backwards was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet to instill fear and caution in the students years later rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his hearts desire the novels ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet
The Mismeasure of Man,Stephen Jay Gould,the mismeasure of man is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism about the supposed biologically inherited genetic basis for human intelligence such as craniometry the measurement of skull volume and its relation to intellectual faculties gould proposed that much of the research was based more upon the racial and social prejudices of the researchers than upon their scientific objectivity that on occasion researchers such as samuel george morton louis agassiz and paul broca committed the methodological fallacy of including their personal a priori expectations to the conclusions as part of their analytical reasoning gould describes mortons rather imprecise technique of filling skulls with bird seed to obtain endocranial volume data and how morton had probably pushed down bird seed in the white skulls so that they had more volume gould re worked morton s original endocranial volume data and concluded that the original results were based upon biases selective data use and perhaps outright falsification of the results when said biases are accounted the original hypothesis an ordering in skull volume ranging from blacks to mongols to whites is unsupported by the data the mismeasure of man presents a historical evaluation of the concepts of the intelligence quotient iq and of the general intelligence factor g factor which were and are the measures for intelligence used by psychologists gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased by the belief that the human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity he cites the burt affair about the allegedly fraudulent oft cited twin studies by cyril burt wherein he claimed that human intelligence is highly heritabile as an evolutionary biologist and historian of science gould accepted biological variability the premise of the transmission of intelligence via genetic heredity but opposed biological determinism which posits that genes determine a definitive unalterable social destiny for each man and each woman in life and society the mismeasure of man is an analysis of statistical correlation the mathematics applied by psychologists to establish the validity of iq tests and the heritability of intelligence for example to establish the validity of the proposition that iq is supported by a general intelligence factor g factor the answers to several tests of cognitive ability must positively correlate thus for the g factor to be a heritable trait the iq test scores of close relation respondents must correlate more than the iq test scores of distant relation respondents hence correlation does not imply causation in example gould said that the measures of the changes over time in my age the population of m xico the price of swiss cheese my pet turtle s weight and the average distance between galaxies have a high positive correlation yet that correlation does not indicate that gould s age increased because the mexican population increased more specifically a high positive correlation between the intelligence quotients of a parent and a child can be presumed either as evidence that iq is genetically inherited or that iq is inherited through social and environmental factors moreover because the data from iq tests can be applied to arguing the logical validity of either proposition genetic inheritance and environmental inheritance the psychometric data have no inherent value gould proposed that if the genetic heritability of iq were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group it would not explain the causes of iq differences among the people of a group or if said iq differences can be attributed to the environment for example the height of a person is genetically determined but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors e g the quality of nutrition and to genetic inheritance the evolutionary biologist richard lewontin a colleague of gould s is a proponent of said argument in relation to the cognitive ability tests that determine a person s intelligence quotient an example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not is the statement if all environments were to become equal for everyone heritability would rise to percent because all remaining differences in iq would necessarily be genetic in origin which gould said is misleading at best and false at worst first it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man woman and child grew up in the same environment because their spatial and temporal dispersion upon the planet earth makes it impossible second were people to grew up in the same environment not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development therefore heritability is not a measure of phenotypic physiognomy and physique differences among racial and ethnic groups but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population furthermore he dismissed the proposition that an iq score measures the general intelligence g factor of a person because cognitive ability tests iq tests present different types of questions and the responses tend to form clusters of intellectual acumen that is different questions and the answers to them yield different scores which indicate that an iq test is a combination method of different examinations of different things as such gould proposed that iq test proponents assume the existence of general intelligence as a discrete quality within the human mind and thus they analyze the iq test data to produce an iq number that establishes the definitive general intelligence of each man and of each woman hence dr gould dismissed the iq number as an erroneous artifact of the statistical mathematics applied to the raw iq test data especially because psychometric data can be variously analyzed to produce multiple iq scores
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,the novel begins on a beautiful summer day with lord henry wotton a strongly opinionated man observing the sensitive artist basil hallward painting the portrait of a handsome young man named dorian gray who is basils ultimate muse after hearing lord henrys world view dorian begins to think beauty is the only worthwhile aspect of life he wishes that the portrait basil painted would grow old in his place under the influence of lord henry who relishes the hedonic lifestyle and is a major exponent thereof dorian begins to explore his senses he discovers amazing actress sibyl vane who performs shakespeare plays in a dingy theatre dorian approaches her and soon proposes marriage sibyl who refers to him as prince charming swoons with happiness but her protective brother james tells her that if prince charming harms her he will certainly kill him dorian invites basil and lord henry to see sibyl perform in romeo and juliet sibyl whose only knowledge of love was love of theatre casts aside her acting abilities through the experience of true love with dorian disheartened dorian rejects her saying her beauty was in her acting and he is no longer interested in her when he returns home he notices that his portrait has changed dorian realizes his wish has come true the portrait now bears a subtle sneer and will age with each sin he commits while his own appearance remains unchanged he decides to reconcile with sibyl but lord henry later informs him that she has killed herself by swallowing prussic acid dorian realizes that lust and looks are where his life is headed and he needs nothing else over the next years he experiments with every vice mostly under the influence of a poisonous french decadence novel a present from lord henry the title is never revealed in the novel but at oscar wildes trial he admitted that he had had in mind joris karl huysmanss rebours against nature one night before he leaves for paris basil arrives to question dorian about rumours of his indulgences dorian does not deny his debauchery he takes basil to the portrait which is as hideous as dorians sins in anger dorian blames basil for his fate and stabs basil to death he then blackmails an old friend named alan campbell a chemist into destroying basils body wishing to escape the guilt of his crime dorian travels to an opium den james vane is present there and attempts to shoot dorian after he hears someone refer to dorian as prince charming however he is deceived when dorian fools james into thinking he is too young to have been involved with sibyl years earlier james releases dorian but is approached by a woman from the opium den who chastises him for not killing dorian revealing dorian has not aged for years james attempts to run after him only to find dorian long gone while at dinner dorian sees james stalking the grounds and fears for his life however during a game shooting party a few days later a lurking james is accidentally shot and killed by one of the hunters during this game shooting party dorian develops feelings for lord henry after returning to london dorian tells lord henry that he will be good from now on and has started by not breaking the heart of his latest innocent conquest named hetty merton dorian wonders if the portrait has begun to change back now that he has given up his immoral ways he unveils the portrait to find it has become worse seeing this he realizes that the motives behind his self sacrifice were merely vanity curiosity and the quest for new emotional experiences deciding that only full confession will absolve him he decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience in a rage he picks up the knife that killed basil hallward and plunges it into the painting his servants wake hearing a cry from inside the locked room and passers by on the street fetch the police the servants find dorians body stabbed in the heart and suddenly aged withered and horrible it is only through the rings on his hand that the corpse can be identified beside him however the portrait has reverted to its original form
The Sentinel,Arthur C. Clarke,the story deals with the discovery of an artifact on earths moon left behind eons ago by ancient aliens the object is made of a polished mineral and tetrahedral in shape and is surrounded by a spherical forcefield the narrator speculates at one point that the mysterious aliens who left this structure on the moon may have used mechanisms belonging to a technology that lies beyond our horizons perhaps to the technology of para physical forces the narrator speculates that for millions of years evidenced by dust buildup around its forcefield the artifact has been transmitting signals into deep space but it ceases to transmit when some time later it is destroyed with the savage might of atomic power the narrator hypothesises that this sentinel was left on the moon as a warning beacon for possible intelligent and spacefaring species that might develop on earth in a space odyssey the operation of the sentinel is reversed it is the energy of the sun falling for the first time on the uncovered artifact that triggers the signal that creatures from the earth had taken the first step into space
The Fountains of Paradise,Arthur C. Clarke,in the nd century dr vannevar morgan is a famous structural engineer who hopes to develop the space elevator from a theoretical concept to reality and enlists the resources of his employers to carry out experiments but the only suitable starting point earth station for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in taprobane occupied by an ancient order of buddhist monks who implacably oppose the plan morgan is approached by a mars based consortium to develop the elevator on mars as part of a massive terraforming project to demonstrate the viability of the technology morgan tries to run a thin cable of hyperfilament from an orbital factory down to ground level at taprobane a monk at the monastery a former astrophysicist who is a mathematical genius tries to sabotage the attempt by creating an artificial hurricane using a hijacked weather control satellite his attempt is in fact successful but in an ironic twist the hurricane blows butterflies to the peak of the mountain this fulfills an ancient prophecy that causes the monks to leave the mountain the tower can be built on earth after all forced to resign his position for acting beyond his authority morgan joins the martian consortium named astroengineering and construction of the tower commences several years later the earth based tower is well under construction and travel up and down mdash both for tourists and for transfer to rocket ships mdash is being trialled an astrophysicist and a group of his students and tower staff are stranded in an emergency chamber six hundred kilometres up after an accident with their transport capsule they have limited food and air supplies whilst a laser on a weather control satellite is able to supply heat it is imperative to provide them with filter masks against the increasing carbon dioxide and also with food air and medical supplies a theme earlier explored in clarkes novel the sands of mars despite his rapidly failing health morgan asserts his right to travel up the tower in a one man spider to rescue them he nearly fails with limited battery power but ultimately succeeds in reaching the chamber as morgan surveys the progress of his brainchild his heart disease claims his life a short epilogue envisages earth many centuries later after the sun has cooled and earth has been depopulated with humans now living on the terraformed inner planets several space elevators lead to a giant circumterran space station that encircles earth at geostationary altitude the analogy with a wheel is evident the space station itself is the wheel rim earth is the axle and the six equidistant space elevators the spokes
Lord of the Flies,William Golding,in the midst of a wartime evacuation a british plane crashes onto an isolated island in a remote region of the pacific ocean the only survivors are male children below the age of thirteen two boys the fair haired ralph and an overweight bespectacled boy reluctantly nicknamed piggy find a conch which ralph uses as a horn to bring all the survivors to one area ralph emerges as one of the survivors leaders during the meeting as does jack merridew a member of a boys choir that survived the crash the survivors elect ralph as their chief losing only the votes of jacks fellow choirboys who support their leader ralph asserts two primary goals to have fun and to maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island the boys decide that a conch shell they found embodies the society they shall create on the island and declare that whoever holds the conch shall also receive the respect of the larger group jack organises his choir group into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source ralph jack and a boy named simon soon form a troika of leaders piggy although ralphs only confidante is quickly made an outcast by his fellow biguns older boys and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children simon in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters feels an instinctive need to protect the younger boys the semblance of order imposed by ralph and simon quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle and begin to develop paranoias about the island referring to a supposed monster the beast which dwells nearby jack who has started a power struggle with ralph gains control of the discussion by boldly promising to kill the beast at one point jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire after the fire burns out a ship passes by the island but does not stop as it has seen nothing amiss angered by this ralph considers relinquishing his position but is convinced not to do so by piggy while jack schemes against ralph twins sam and eric now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire see the corpse of a fighter pilot in the dark mistaking the corpse for the beast they run to the cluster of shelters that ralph and simon have erected and warn the others this unexpected meeting sees tensions between jack and ralph flare again shortly thereafter jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island where a heap of stones forms a place where he claims the beast resides only ralph and jacks supporter roger agree to go ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys when they arrive at the shelters jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against ralph asking for them to remove him from his position receiving little support jack roger and another boy leave the shelters to form their own tribe the tribe which receives recruits from the main group of boys grows in strength and begins to adopt customs common to primitive cultures including face paint and bizarre rituals including sacrifices to the beast when the tribe grows to a size that rivals ralphs they begin to harass those who remain at the shelters and make pronouncements encouraging them to abandon ralph and the societal order he has imposed simon unable to bear the stress of his position goes off to think alone he finds a severed pig head left by jack as an offering to the beast simon envisions the pig head now swarming with scavenging flies as the lord of the flies and believes that it is talking to him simon hears the pig identifying itself as the real beast and disclosing the truth about itself nbsp that the boys themselves created the beast and that the real beast was inside them all simon also locates the dead parachutist who had been mistaken for the beast and is the sole member of the group to recognise that the monster is a cadaver simon hoping to tell others of the discovery finds jacks tribe in the islands interior during a ritual dance and mistaken for the beast is killed by the frenzied boys ralph piggy sam and eric feel guilty about what they did not stop jack and his band of savages decide that they should possess piggys glasses the only means of starting a fire on the island raiding ralphs camp the savages confiscate the glasses and return to their abode near the great rock heap called castle rock ralph deserted by most of his supporters journeys to castle rock to confront jack and secure the glasses taking the conch and accompanied only by piggy sam and eric ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object turning against ralph the tribe takes sam and eric captive while roger drops a boulder from his vantage point above killing piggy and shattering the conch ralph manages to escape but sam and eric are tortured until they agree to join jacks tribe the following morning jack orders his tribe to begin a manhunt for ralph fleeing through the forest ralph watches as the savages set fire to the forest drawing the attention of a passing naval vessel a landing party from the vessel encounters ralph as he desperately tries to escape the onrushing savages and the british officer leading the party at first mistaking the violence for a game expected better from british boys
Through the Looking-Glass,Lewis Carroll,alice is playing with a white kitten whom she calls snowdrop and a black kitten whom she calls kitty the offspring of dinah alices cat in alices adventures in wonderland when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirrors reflection climbing up on the fireplace mantel she pokes at the wall hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers to her surprise that she is able to step through it to an alternative world in this reflected version of her own house she finds a book with looking glass poetry jabberwocky whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror she also observes that the chess pieces have come to life though they remain small enough for her to pick up upon leaving the house where it had been a cold snowy night she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers have the power of human speech they perceive alice as being a flower that can move about elsewhere in the garden alice meets the red queen now human sized who impresses alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once in any direction making them the most agile of the pieces the red queen reveals to alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares like a gigantic chessboard and offers to make alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank row in a chess match alice is placed in the second rank as one of the white queens pawns and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move she then meets the fat twin brothers tweedledum and tweedledee whom she knows from the famous nursery rhyme after reciting the long poem the walrus and the carpenter the tweedles draw alices attention to the red king loudly snoring away under a nearby tree and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the red kings dreams thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up finally the brothers begin acting out their nursery rhyme by suiting up for battle only to be frightened away by an enormous crow as the nursery rhyme about them predicts alice next meets the white queen who is very absent minded but boasts of and demonstrates her ability to remember future events before they have happened alice and the white queen advance into the chessboards fifth rank by crossing over a brook together but at the very moment of the crossing the queen transforms into a talking sheep in a small shop alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat where the sheep annoys her with seemingly nonsensical shouting about crabs and feathers unknown to alice these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing and thus the queen sheep for a change is speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way after crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank alice immediately encounters humpty dumpty who besides celebrating his unbirthday provides his own translation of the strange terms in jabberwocky in the process introducing alice and the reader to the concept of portmanteau words before his inevitable fall all the kings horses and all the kings men come to humpty dumptys assistance naturally and are accompanied by the white king along with the lion and the unicorn who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting each other in this chapter the march hare and hatter of the first book make a brief re appearance in the guise of anglo saxon messengers called haigha and hatta i e hare and hatter these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than john tenniels illustrations upon leaving the lion and unicorn to their fight alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the red knight who is intent on capturing the white pawn alice until the white knight comes to her rescue escorting her through the forest towards the final brook crossing the knight recites a long poem of his own composition and repeatedly falls off his horse his clumsiness is a reference to the eccentric l shaped movements of chess knights and may also be interpreted as a self deprecating joke about lewis carrolls own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life bidding farewell to the white knight alice steps across the last brook and is automatically crowned a queen the crown materialising abruptly on her head she soon finds herself in the company of both the white and red queens who relentlessly confound alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion they then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned alice of which alice herself had no prior knowledge alice arrives and seats herself at her own party which quickly turns to a chaotic uproar much like the ending of the first book in which alice finally grabs the red queen believing her to be responsible for all the days nonsense and begins shaking her violently with all her might by thus capturing the red queen alice unknowingly puts the red king who has remained stationary throughout the book into checkmate and is allowed to wake up alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten whom she deduces to have been the red queen all along with the white kitten having been the white queen the story ends with alice recalling the speculation of the tweedle brothers that everything may have in fact been a dream of the red king and that alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination one final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream
Waiting for Godot,Samuel Beckett,waiting for godot follows a pair of men who divert themselves while waiting expectantly vainly for someone named godot to arrive they claim hes an acquaintance but in fact hardly know him admitting that they would not recognize him when they do see him to occupy the time they eat sleep converse argue sing play games exercise swap hats and contemplate suicide anything to hold the terrible silence at bay the play opens with estragon struggling to remove a boot estragon eventually gives up muttering nothing to be done his friend vladimir takes up the thought and muses on it the implication being that nothing is a thing that has to be done and this pair is going to have to spend the rest of the play doing it when estragon finally succeeds in removing his boot he looks and feels inside but finds nothing just prior to this vladimir peers into his hat the motif recurs throughout the play the pair discuss repentance particularly in relation to the two thieves crucified alongside jesus and that only one of the four evangelists mentions that one of them was saved this is the first of numerous biblical references in the play which may be linked to its putative central theme of the search for and reconciliation with god as well as salvation were saved they cry on more than one occasion when they feel that godot may be near presently vladimir expresses his frustration with estragons limited conversational skills come on gogo return the ball cant you once in a while estragon struggles with this throughout the play and vladimir generally takes the lead in dialogue and encounters with others vladimir is at times hostile towards his companion but in general they are close frequently embracing and supporting one another estragon peers out into the audience and comments on the bleakness of his surroundings he wants to depart but is told that they cannot because they must wait for godot the pair cannot agree however on whether or not they are in the right place or that this is the arranged day for their meeting with godot they are not even sure what day it is throughout the play experienced time is attenuated fractured or eerily non existent the only thing that they are fairly sure about is that they are to meet at a tree there is one nearby estragon dozes off but after rousing him vladimir is not interested in hearing about his dream estragon wants to hear an old joke about a brothel which vladimir starts but cannot finish as he is suddenly compelled to rush off and urinate he does not finish the story when he returns asking estragon instead what else they might do to pass the time estragon suggests that they hang themselves but they abandon the idea when it seems that they might not both die leaving one of them alone an intolerable notion they decide to do nothing its safer explains estragon before asking what godot is going to do for them when he arrives for once it is vladimir who struggles to remember oh nothing very definite is the best that he can manage when estragon declares that he is hungry vladimir provides a carrot most of which and without much relish the former eats the diversion ends as estragon announces that they still have nothing to do their waiting is interrupted by the passing through of pozzo and his heavily laden slave lucky a terrible cry from the wings heralds the initial entrance of lucky who has a rope tied around his neck his master appears holding the other end pozzo barks orders at his slave and frequently calls him a pig but is civil towards the other two they mistake him at first for godot and clearly do not recognise him for the self proclaimed personage he is this irks him but while maintaining that the land that they are on is his he acknowledges that the road is free to all deciding to rest for a while pozzo enjoys chicken and wine finished he casts the bones aside and estragon jumps at the chance to ask for them much to vladimirs embarrassment but is told that they belong to the carrier he must first therefore ask lucky if he wants them estragon tries but lucky only hangs his head refusing to answer taking this as a no estragon claims the bones vladimir takes pozzo to task regarding his mistreatment of his slave but his protestations are ignored when the original pairing tries to find out why lucky does not put down his load at least not unless his master is prevailing on him to do something else pozzo explains that lucky is attempting to mollify him to prevent him from selling him at this lucky begins to cry pozzo provides a handkerchief but when estragon tries to wipe his tears away lucky kicks him before he leaves pozzo asks if he can do anything for the pair in exchange for the company they have provided during his rest estragon tries to ask for some money but vladimir cuts him short explaining that they are not beggars they nevertheless accept an offer to have lucky dance and to think the dance is clumsy and shuffling luckys think induced by vladimirs putting his hat on his head is a lengthy and disjointed verbal stream of consciousness the soliloquy begins relatively coherently but quickly dissolves into logorrhoea and only ends when vladimir rips off luckys hat once lucky has been revived pozzo has him pack up his things and they leave at the end of the act and its successor a boy arrives purporting to be a messenger sent from godot to advise the pair that he will not be coming that evening but surely tomorrow during vladimirs interrogation of the boy he asks if he came the day before making it apparent that the two men have been waiting for an indefinite period and will likely continue to wait ad infinitum after the boy departs they decide to leave but make no attempt to do so an action repeated in act ii as the curtain is drawn act ii opens with vladimir singing a recursive round about a dog which could illustrate the cyclical nature of the plays universe and also point toward the plays debt to the carnivalesque music hall traditions and vaudeville comedy this is only one of a number of canine references and allusions in the play there is a bit of realisation by vladimir that the world they are trapped in evinces convoluted progression or lack thereof of time he begins to see that although there is notional evidence of linear progression basically he is living the same day over and over eugene webb has written of vladimirs song that time in the song is not a linear sequence but an endlessly reiterated moment the content of which is only one eternal event death once again estragon maintains he spent the night in a ditch and was beaten by ten of them this time though he shows no sign of injury vladimir tries to talk to him about what appears to be a seasonal change in the tree and the proceedings of the day before but he has only a vague recollection vladimir tries to get estragon to remember pozzo and lucky but all he can call to mind are the bones and getting kicked vladimir realises an opportunity to produce tangible evidence of the previous days events with some difficulty he gets estragon to show him his leg there is a wound which is beginning to fester only then vladimir notices that estragon is not wearing any boots he discovers the pair of boots which estragon insists are not his but nevertheless fit when he tries them on with no carrots left vladimir offers estragon the choice between a turnip and a radish he opts for the radish but it is black and he hands it back he decides to try to sleep again and adopts the same fetal position as the previous day vladimir sings him a lullaby vladimir notices luckys hat and tries it on this leads to a frenetic hat swapping scene they play at imitating pozzo and lucky but estragon can barely remember having met them and simply does what vladimir asks they fire insults at each other and then make up after that they attempt some physical routines which do not work out well and even attempt a single yoga position which fails miserably pozzo and lucky arrive with pozzo now blind and insisting that lucky is dumb the rope is much shorter and lucky who has acquired a new hat leads pozzo rather than being driven by him pozzo has lost all notion of time and assures them he cannot remember meeting them the day before and does not expect to remember the current days events when they are over they fall in a heap estragon sees an opportunity to extort more food or to exact revenge on lucky for kicking him the issue is debated pozzo offers them money but vladimir sees more worth in their entertainment since they are compelled to wait to see if godot arrives eventually though they all find their way onto their feet whereas pozzo in act i is a windbag he now as a blind man appears to have gained some insight his parting words which vladimir expands upon later eloquently encapsulate the brevity of human existence they give birth astride of a grave the light gleams an instant then its night once more lucky and pozzo depart the same boy returns to inform them not to expect godot today but promises he will arrive the next day the two again consider suicide but their rope

2010: Odyssey Two,Arthur C. Clarke,the story is set nine years after the failure of the discovery one mission to jupiter a joint soviet american crew including heywood floyd from on the soviet spaceship alexei leonov named after the famous cosmonaut arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet and to resolve the disappearance of david bowman they hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now abandoned discovery one the soviets have an advanced new sakharov drive which will propel them to jupiter ahead of the american discovery two so floyd is assigned to the leonov crew however a chinese space station rockets out of earth orbit revealing itself to be the interplanetary spacecraft tsien also aimed at jupiter the leonov crewmembers think the chinese are on a one way trip due to its speed but floyd surmises that due to the large water content of europa they intend to land there and use the water content to refuel the tsiens daring mission ends in failure when it is destroyed by an indigenous life form on europa the only survivor radios the story to the leonov it is presumed that he dies when his spacesuit air supply runs out the leonov survives a dangerous aerobraking around jupiter and arrives at discovery mission crewmember and hal s creator dr chandra reactivates the computer to ascertain the cause of his earlier aberrant behavior after some time floyd is speaking to a russian on board who for an instant sees the monolith open again into a stargate as david bowman escapes from the monoliths universe back into ours a sequence of scenes follows the explorations of david bowman who has been transformed into a non corporeal energy based life form much like the aliens controlling the monoliths during his journey the avatar of bowman travels to earth making contact with significant individuals from his human past he visits his mother and brushes her hair shortly before she dies and he appears to his ex girlfriend on her television screen in the novel the aliens are using bowman as a probe to learn about humankind he then returns to the jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of europa where he finds aquatic life forms and under the clouds of jupiter where he discovers gaseous life forms both are primitive but the aliens deem the europan creatures to have evolutionary potential an apparition of bowman appears before floyd warning him that they must leave jupiter within days floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew at first but then the monolith vanishes from orbit and a mysterious dark spot appears on jupiter and begins to grow hals telescope observations reveal that the great black spot is in fact a vast population of monoliths increasing at an exponential rate which appear to be eating the planet the leonov crew devises a plan to use the discovery as a booster rocket enabling them to return to earth ahead of schedule unfortunately hal and the discovery will be trapped in jupiters orbit with insufficient fuel to escape the crew are worried that hal will have the same neuroses on discovering that he will be abandoned yet again so chandra must convince hal that the human crew is in danger the leonov crew flees jupiter as the swarm of monoliths spread to engulf the planet by acting as self replicating von neumann machines these monoliths increase jupiters density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion becoming a small star in the novel this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the jovian atmosphere which the monoliths controllers had deemed less worthy than the aquatic life of europa as jupiter is about to transform bowman returns to discovery to give hal a last order to carry out hal begins repeatedly broadcasting the message the creation of the new star which earth eventually names lucifer destroys discovery however in appreciation for hals help bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove hals artificial intelligence from discoverys computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as david bowman and becomes his companion the book ends with a brief epilogue which takes place in ad by this time the europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilization most likely with assistance from a monolith they are not described in detail though they are said to have tendril like limbs they regard the star lucifer formerly the planet jupiter as their primary sun referring to ours as the cold sun though their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of europa which is constantly bathed in lucifers rays some europans have begun in recent generations to explore the farside the hemisphere facing away from lucifer which is still covered in ice there they may witness the spectacle of night unknown on the other side of europa when the cold sun sets the europans who explore the farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations they correctly believe that lucifer was not always there they believe that the cold sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime the europans also see three other major bodies in the sky one seems to be constantly engulfed in fire and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading these three bodies are the moons io callisto and ganymede the latter two of which are presently being colonized by humans humans have been attempting to explore europa ever since lucifer was created in however none of these attempts has been successful every probe that has attempted to land on europa has been destroyed in the atmosphere as it is later shown in and manned spacecraft that attempt to land have been instead diverted by an external force the debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is venerated by the europans finally there is a monolith on the planet which is worshipped by the europans more than anything else the europans assume correctly that the monolith is what keeps humans at bay dave bowman and hal lie dormant in this monolith the monolith is the guardian of europa and will continue to prevent contact between humans and europans for as long as it sees fit
Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,the novel opens in london in ad in the gregorian calendar the vast majority of the population is unified under the world state an eternally peaceful stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful because the population is permanently limited to no more than two billion people and everyone is happy natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created decanted and raised in hatcheries and conditioning centres where they are divided into five castes which are further split into plus and minus members and designed to fulfill predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the world state fetuses chosen to become members of the highest caste alpha are allowed to develop naturally while maturing to term in decanting bottles while fetuses chosen to become members of the lower castes beta gamma delta epsilon are subjected to in situ chemical interference to cause arrested development in intelligence or physical growth each alpha or beta is the product of one unique fertilized egg developing into one unique fetus members of lower castes are not unique but are instead created using the bokanovsky process which enables a single egg to spawn at the point of the story being told up to children and one ovary to produce thousands of children to further increase the birthrate of gammas deltas and epsilons podsnaps technique causes all the eggs in the ovary to mature simultaneously allowing the hatchery to get full use of the ovary in two years time people of these castes make up the majority of human society and the production of such specialized children bolsters the efficiency and harmony of society since these people are deliberately limited in their cognitive and physical abilities as well as the scope of their ambitions and the complexity of their desires thus rendering them easier to control all children are educated via the hypnopaedic process which provides each child with caste appropriate subconscious messages to mold the childs lifelong self image and social outlook to that chosen by the leaders and their predetermined plans for producing future adult generations to maintain the world states command economy for the indefinite future all citizens are conditioned from birth to value consumption with such platitudes as ending is better than mending more stiches less riches i e buy a new item instead of fixing the old one because constant consumption and near universal employment to meet societys material demands is the bedrock of economic and social stability for the world state beyond providing social engagement and distraction in the material realm of work or play the need for transcendence solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma soma is an allusion to a mythical drink of the same name consumed by ancient indo aryans in the book soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable hangover free holidays it was developed by the world state to provide these inner directed personal experiences within a socially managed context of state run religious organizations social clubs the hypnopaedically inculcated affinity for the state produced drug as a self medicating comfort mechanism in the face of stress or discomfort thereby eliminates the need for religion or other personal allegiances outside or beyond the world state recreational sex is an integral part of society according to the world state sex is a social activity rather than a means of reproduction sex is encouraged from early childhood the few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control even wearing a malthusian belt which resembles a cartridge belt and holds the regulation supply of contraceptives as a popular fashion accessory the maxim everyone belongs to everyone else is repeated often and the idea of a family is considered pornographic sexual competition and emotional romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed marriage natural birth parenthood and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation thus society has developed a new idea of reproductive comprehension spending time alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money and wanting to be an individual is horrifying conditioning trains people to consume and never to enjoy being alone so by spending an afternoon not playing obstacle golf or not in bed with a friend one is forfeiting acceptance in the world state people typically die at age having maintained good health and youthfulness their whole life death isnt feared anyone reflecting upon it is reassured by the knowledge that everyone is happy and that society goes on since no one has family they have no ties to mourn the conditioning system eliminates the need for professional competitiveness people are literally bred to do their jobs and cannot desire another there is no competition within castes each caste member receives the same food housing and soma rationing as every other member of that caste there is no desire to change ones caste largely because a persons sleep conditioning reinforces each individuals place in the caste system to grow closer with members of the same class citizens participate in mock religious services called solidarity services in which twelve people consume large quantities of soma and sing hymns the ritual progresses through group hypnosis and climaxes in an orgy in geographic areas nonconducive to easy living and consumption securely contained groups of savages are left to their own devices these appear to be similar to the reservations of land established for the native american population during the colonisation of north america these savages are beholden of strange customs including self mutilation and religion a mere curio in the outside world in its first chapters the novel describes life in the world state as wonderful and introduces lenina crowne and bernard marx lenina a hatchery worker is socially accepted and comfortable with her place in society while bernard a psychologist is an outcast although an alpha plus bernard is shorter in stature than the average of his caste a quality shared by the lower castes which gives him an inferiority complex his work with sleep teaching has led him to realize that what others believe to be their own deeply held beliefs are merely phrases repeated to children while they are asleep still he recognizes the necessity of such programming as the reason why his society meets the emotional needs of its citizens courting disaster he is vocal about being different once stating he dislikes soma because hed rather be himself bernards differences fuel rumors that he was accidentally administered alcohol while incubated a method used to keep epsilons short bernards only friend is helmholtz watson an alpha plus lecturer at the college of emotional engineering department of writing the friendship is based on their similar experiences as misfits but unlike bernard watsons sense of loneliness stems from being too gifted too intelligent too handsome and too physically strong helmholtz is drawn to bernard as a confidant he can talk to bernard about his desire to write poetry bernard is on holiday at a savage reservation the reservation located in new mexico consists of a community named malpais from afar lenina thinks it will be exciting in person she finds the aged toothless natives who mend their clothes rather than throw them away repugnant and the situation is made worse when she discovers that she has left her soma tablets at the resort hotel in typical tourist fashion bernard and lenina watch what at first appears to be a quaint native ceremony the village folk whose culture resembles the contemporary indian groups of the region descendants of the anasazi including the puebloan peoples of acoma laguna and zuni and the ramah navajo begin by singing but the ritual quickly becomes a passion play where a village boy is whipped to unconsciousness soon after the couple encounters linda a woman who has been living in malpais since she came on a trip and became separated from her group among whom was a man to whom she refers as tomakin but who is revealed to be bernards boss the director of hatcheries and conditioning thomas she became pregnant despite adhering to her malthusian drill and there were no facilities for an abortion her shame at pregnancy was so great that she decided not to return to her old life but to stay with the savages linda gave birth to a son john later referred to as john the savage who is now conversations with linda and john reveal that their life has been hard for years they have been treated as outsiders the native men treated linda like a sex object while the native women regularly beat and ostracized her because of her promiscuity and john was mistreated and excluded for his mothers actions and the color of his skin john was angered by lindas lovers and even attacked one in a jealous rage while a child johns one joy was that his mother had taught him to read although he only had two books a scientific manual from his mothers job which he called a beastly beastly book and a collection of shakespeares works which have been banned in the world state for being subversive shakespeare gives john articulation to his feelings though and he especially is interested in othello romeo and juliet and hamlet at the same time john has been denied the religious rituals of the village although he has watched them and even has had some religious experiences on his own in the desert old weathered and tired linda wants to return to her familiar world in london as she misses living in the city and taking soma john wants to see the brave new world his mother has told him so much about bernard wants to take them back to block thomas from his plan to reassign bernard to iceland as punishment for his asocial beliefs bernard arranges permission for linda and john to leave the reservation john also seems to have an attraction to lenina as while bernard is away getting the permission to move the savages he finds her suitcase and ruffles through all of her clothes taking in the smells he then sees her sleeping and stares at her thinking all he has to do to see her properly is undo one zip he later tells himself off for being like this towards lenina and seems to be extremely shy around her upon his return to london bernard is confronted by thomas the director of the hatchery and conditioning centre who in front of an audience of higher caste centre workers denounces bernard for his asocial behavior bernard thinking that for the first time in his life he has the upper hand defends himself by presenting the director with his long lost lover and unknown son linda and john john falls to his knees and calls thomas his father which causes an uproar of laughter the humiliated director resigns in shame spared from reassignment bernard makes john the toast of london pursued by the highest members of society able to bed any woman he fancies bernard revels in attention he once scorned the victory however is short lived linda decrepit toothless and friendless goes on a permanent soma holiday while john appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society refuses to attend bernards parties society drops bernard as swiftly as it had taken him bernard turns to the person hed believed to be his one true friend only to see helmholtz fall into a quick easy camaraderie with john bernard is left an outcast yet again as he watches the only two men with whom he ever connected find more of interest in each other than they ever did in him john and helmholtzs island of peace is brief lenina tries to seduce john but john pushes her away calling her out on her sexually wanton ways whilst lenina is in the bathroom humiliated and putting her clothes on john receives a telephone call from the hospital telling him that his mother is extremely unwell he rushes over to see her and sits at her bedside trying to get her out of her soma holiday so that he can talk to her he is heartbroken when his mother succumbs to soma and dies he is extremely annoyed by the young boys that enter the ward to be conditioned about death and annoy john to the point where he starts to use violence to send them away johns grief bewilders and revolts the hospital workers and their lack of reaction to lindas death prompts john to try to force humanity from the workers by throwing their soma rations out a window the ensuing riot brings the police who quell the riot by filling the room with soma bernard and helmholtz arrive to help john but only helmholtz helps him while bernard stands to the side torn between risking involvement by helping or escaping the scene following the riot bernard helmholtz and john are brought before mustapha mond the resident world controller for western europe bernard who breaks down during the middle of the conversation and helmholtz are told they will be exiled to islands of their choice mond explains that this exile is not so much a threat to force freethinkers to reform and rejoin society as it is a chance for them to act as they please because they will not be able to influence the population he also divulges that he too once risked banishment to an island because of some scientific experiments that were deemed controversial by the state giving insight into his sympathetic tone helmholtz chooses the falkland islands believing that their terrible weather will inspire his writing but bernard simply does not want to leave london he struggles with mond and is thrown out of the office after bernard and helmholtz have left mustapha and john engage in a philosophical argument on the morals behind the existing society and then john is told the experiment will continue and he will not be sent to an island john meets with bernard and helmholtz once again before their departures from london and bernard apologizes to john for his opportunistic behavior having come to terms with his imminent exile and having restored his friendship with helmholtz in the final chapter john isolates himself from society in a lighthouse outside london where he finds his hermit life interrupted from mourning his mother by the more bitter memories of civilization to atone john brutally whips himself in the open a ritual the indians in his own village had denied him his self flagellation caught on film and shown publicly destroys his hermit life hundreds of gawking sightseers intrigued by johns violent behavior fly out to watch the savage in person even lenina comes to watch crying a tear john does not see the sight of the woman whom he both adores and blames is too much for him john attacks and whips her this sight of genuine unbridled emotion drives the crowd wild with excitement and handling it as they are conditioned to they turn on each other in a frenzy of beating and chanting that devolves into a mass orgy of soma and sex in the morning john hopeless alone horrified by his drug use and the orgy in which he participated that countered his beliefs makes one last attempt to escape civilization and atone when thousands of gawking sightseers arrive that morning frenzied at the prospect of seeing the savage perform again they find john dead from a suicidal hanging
Aeneid,Virgil,the aeneid can be divided into two halves based on the disparate subject matter of books aeneas journey to latium in italy and books the war in latium these two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting virgils ambition to rival homer by treating both the odysseys wandering theme and the iliads warfare themes this is however a rough correspondence the limitations of which should be borne in mind virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme arma virumque cano nbsp i sing of arms and of a man nbsp and an invocation to the muse falling some seven lines after the poems inception musa mihi causas memora nbsp o muse recount to me the causes nbsp he then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story the resentment held by the goddess juno against the trojan people this is consistent with her role throughout the homeric epics also in the manner of homer the story proper begins in medias res with the trojan fleet in the eastern mediterranean heading in the direction of italy the fleet led by aeneas is on a voyage to find a second home it has been foretold that in italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous a race which will become known to all nations juno is wrathful because she had not been chosen in the judgment of paris and because her favorite city carthage will be destroyed by aeneas descendants also ganymede a trojan prince was chosen to be her husband jupiters cup bearer replacing junos daughter hebe juno proceeds to aeolus king of the winds and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe deiopea the loveliest of all her sea nymphs as a wife despite refusing her bribe he agrees and the storm devastates the fleet neptune takes notice although he himself is no friend of the trojans he is infuriated by junos intrusion into his domain and stills the winds and calms the waters after making sure that aeolus would not try again the fleet takes shelter on the coast of africa there aeneass mother venus in the form of a hunting woman very similar to the goddess diana encourages him and tells him the history of the city eventually aeneas ventures in and in the temple of juno seeks and gains the favor of dido queen of carthage the city which has only recently been founded by refugees from tyre and which will later become one of romes greatest imperial rivals and enemies at a banquet given in the honour of the trojans aeneas recounts sadly the events which occasioned the trojans fortuitous arrival he begins the tale shortly after the events described in the iliad crafty ulysses devised a way for greek warriors to gain entry into troy by hiding in a large wooden horse the greeks pretended to sail away leaving a man sinon to tell the trojans that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city the trojans would be able to conquer greece the trojan priest laoco n who had seen through the greek plot and urged the horses destruction hurled his spear at the wooden horse just after in what would be seen by the trojans as punishment from the gods laoco n was suddenly grabbed and eaten along with his two sons by two giant sea snakes so the trojans brought the horse inside the fortified walls and after nightfall the armed greeks emerged and began to slaughter the citys inhabitants aeneas woke up and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city at first he tried to fight against the enemy but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off tens of greeks hector the fallen trojan prince had told him in a dream to flee with his family aeneas tells of his escape with his son ascanius and father anchises after various omens his son ascanius head catches fire without his being harmed and then a shooting star his wife creusa having been separated from the others and subsequently killed in the general catastrophe after getting outside troy he goes back for his wife her ghost appears before him and tells him that his destiny is to found rome he tells of how rallying the other survivors he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the mediterranean thrace where they find the last remains of a fellow trojan polydorus the strophades where they encounter the harpy celaeno crete which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city but they are set straight by apollo and buthrotum this last city had been built in an attempt to replicate troy in buthrotum aeneas met andromache the widow of hector she still laments for the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child there too aeneas saw and met helenus one of priams sons who had the gift of prophecy through him aeneas learned the destiny laid out for him he was divinely advised to seek out the land of italy also known as ausonia or hesperia where his descendants would not only prosper but in time rule the entire known world in addition helenus also bade him go to the sibyl in cumae heading out into the open sea aeneas left buthrotum rounding italys cape and making his way towards sicily trinacria there they are caught in the whirlpool of charybdis and driven out to sea soon they come ashore at the land of the cyclops there they meet a greek achaemenides one of ulysses men who had been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of polyphemus they take achaemenides onboard and narrowly escape polyphemus shortly after these events anchises dies peacefully of old age meanwhile venus has her own plans she goes to her son aeneas half brother cupid and tells him to imitate ascanius disguised as such he goes to dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest with her motherly love revived in the presence of the boy her heart is pierced and she falls in love with the boy and his father during the banquet dido realizes that she has fallen madly in love with aeneas although she had previously sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband sychaeus who had been murdered by her brother pygmalion juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with venus aeneas mother with the intention of distracting him from his destiny of founding a city in italy aeneas is inclined to return didos love and during a hunting expedition a storm drives them into a cave in which aeneas and dido presumably have sex an event that dido takes to indicate a marriage between them but when jupiter sends mercury to remind aeneas of his duty he has no choice but to part her heart broken dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with aeneas sword before dying she predicts eternal strife between aeneass people and hers rise up from my bones avenging spirit trans fitzgerald is an obvious invocation to hannibal looking back from the deck of his ship aeneas sees didos funeral pyres smoke and knows its meaning only too clearly however destiny calls and the trojan fleet sails on to italy book takes place on sicily and centers on the funeral games that aeneas organizes for the anniversary of his fathers death aeneas and his men have left carthage for sicily where one year after the death of his father aeneas organizes a nine day anniversary which includes celebratory games a boat race a foot race a boxing match and a shooting contest in all those contests aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers showing his leadership qualities by not allowing for antagonism even after foul play afterward ascanius leads a military parade and demonstration prefiguring romes future predilection for war during those events in which only men participate juno incites the womenfolk to burn the fleet and prevent them from ever reaching italy but her plan is thwarted when ascanius and then aeneas intervene aeneas prays to jupiter to quench the fires which the god does with a torrential rainstorm an anxious aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father who tells him to go down to the underworld to receive a vision of his and romes future which he will do in book in return for safe passage to italy the gods by order of jupiter will receive one of aeneass men as sacrifice palinurus who steers aeneass ship by night falls overboard and is drowned in book aeneas with the guidance of the cumaean sibyl descends into the underworld through an opening at cumae there he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of rome upon returning to the land of the living aeneas leads the trojans to settle in the land of latium where he courts lavinia the daughter of king latinus although aeneas would have wished to avoid it war eventually breaks out juno is heavily involved in causing this war she convinces the queen of latium to demand that lavinia be married to turnus the king of a local people the rutuli juno continues to stir up trouble even summoning the fury alecto to ensure that a war takes place seeing the masses of italians that turnus has brought against him aeneas seeks help from the tuscans enemies of turnus he meets king evander from arcadia whose son pallas agrees to lead troops against the other italians meanwhile the trojan camp is being attacked and a midnight raid leads to the deaths of nisus and his companion euryalus in one of the most emotional passages in the book the gates however are defended until aeneas returns with his tuscan and arcadian reinforcements in the battling that follows many heroes are killed notably pallas who is killed by turnus and mezentius turnus close associate the latter who has inadvertently allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled reproaches himself and faces aeneas in single combat an honourable but essentially futile pursuit another notable hero camilla a sort of amazon character fights bravely but is eventually killed she has been a virgin devoted to diana and to her nation the man who kills her is struck dead by dianas sentinel opis after doing so even though he tries to escape after this single combat is proposed between aeneas and turnus but aeneas is so obviously superior that the italians urged on by turnuss divine sister juturna break the truce aeneas is injured but returns to the battle shortly afterwards turnus and aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings but when aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of latium causing the queen of latium to hang herself in despair he forces turnus into single combat once more in a dramatic scene turnuss strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock and he is struck by aeneass spear in the leg as turnus is begging on his knees for his life the poem ends with aeneas killing him in rage when he sees that turnus is wearing the belt of his friend pallas as a trophy
Paradise Lost,John Milton,the poem is separated into twelve books or sections and the lengths of each book varies greatly the longest being book ix with lines and the shortest book vii having the arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition originally published in ten books in a fully revised and augmented edition with a new division into twelve books was issued this is the edition that is generally used today the poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res latin for in the midst of things the background story being recounted later miltons story has two narrative arcs one being that of satan lucifer and the other being that of adam and eve it begins after satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to hell or as it is also called in the poem tartarus in pand monium satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers he is aided by mammon and beelzebub belial and moloch are also present at the end of the debate satan volunteers to poison the newly created earth and gods new and most favoured creation mankind he braves the dangers of the abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of odysseus or aeneas after an arduous traverse of the chaos outside hell he enters gods new material world and later the garden of eden at one point in the story the angelic war over heaven is recounted satans rebellion follows the epic convention of large scale warfare the battles between the faithful angels and satans forces take place over three days the final battle involves the son of god single handedly defeating the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishing them from heaven following the purging of heaven god creates the world culminating in his creation of adam and eve while god gave adam and eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation he gave them one explicit command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death the story of adam and eves temptation and fall is a fundamentally different new kind of epic a domestic one adam and eve are presented for the first time in christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without sin they have passions and distinct personalities satan disguised in the form of a serpent successfully tempts eve to eat from the tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric adam learning that eve has sinned knowingly commits the same sin he declares to eve that since she was made from his flesh they are bound to one another so that if she dies he must also die in this manner milton portrays adam as a heroic figure but also as a greater sinner than eve as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong after eating the fruit adam and eve have lustful sex and at first adam is convinced that eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial however they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares and after they awake they experience guilt and shame for the first time realizing that they have committed a terrible act against god they engage in mutual recrimination eves pleas to adam reconcile them somewhat her encouragement enables adam and eve both to approach god to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and to receive grace from god adam is shown a vision by the angel michael in which adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the great flood adam is very upset by this vision of humankinds future and so michael also tells him about humankinds potential redemption from original sin through jesus christ whom michael calls king messiah adam and eve are cast out of eden and michael says that adam may find a paradise within thee happier far adam and eve also now have a more distant relationship with god who is omnipresent but invisible unlike the tangible father in the garden of eden

The Myth of Sisyphus,Albert Camus,the essay is dedicated to pascal pia and is organized in four chapters and one appendix camus undertakes to answer what he considers to be the only question of philosophy that matters does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide he begins by describing the absurd condition much of our life is built on the hope for tomorrow yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy people live as if they didnt know about the certainty of death once stripped of its common romanticisms the world is a foreign strange and inhuman place true knowledge is impossible and rationality and science cannot explain the world their stories ultimately end in meaningless abstractions in metaphors from the moment absurdity is recognized it becomes a passion the most harrowing of all it is not the world that is absurd nor human thought the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world when my appetite for the absolute and for unity meets the inability of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle he then characterizes a number of philosophies that describe and attempt to deal with this feeling of the absurd by heidegger jaspers shestov kierkegaard and husserl all of these he claims commit philosophical suicide by reaching conclusions that contradict the original absurd position either by abandoning reason and turning to god as in the case of kierkegaard and shestov or by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous platonic forms and an abstract god as in the case of husserl for camus who set out to take the absurd seriously and follow it to its final conclusions these leaps cannot convince taking the absurd seriously means acknowledging the contradiction between the desire of human reason and the unreasonable world suicide then also must be rejected without man the absurd cannot exist the contradiction must be lived reason and its limits must be acknowledged without false hope however the absurd can never be accepted it requires constant confrontation constant revolt while the question of human freedom in the metaphysical sense loses interest to the absurd man he gains freedom in a very concrete sense no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity without a need to pursue lifes purpose or to create meaning he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules to embrace the absurd implies embracing all that the unreasonable world has to offer without a meaning in life there is no scale of values what counts is not the best living but the most living thus camus arrives at three consequences from the full acknowledging of the absurd revolt freedom and passion how should the absurd man live clearly no ethical rules apply as they are all based on higher powers or on justification integrity has no need of rules everything is permitted is not an outburst of relief or of joy but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact camus then goes on to present examples of the absurd life he begins with don juan the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest there is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short lived and exceptional the next example is the actor who depicts ephemeral lives for ephemeral fame he demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being in those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover camus third example of the absurd man is the conqueror the warrior who forgoes all promises of eternity to affect and engage fully in human history he chooses action over contemplation aware of the fact that nothing can last and no victory is final here camus explores the absurd creator or artist since explanation is impossible absurd art is restricted to a description of the myriad experiences in the world if the world were clear art would not exist absurd creation of course also must refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of hope he then analyzes the work of dostoyevsky in this light especially the diary of a writer the possessed and the brothers karamazov all these works start from the absurd position and the first two explore the theme of philosophical suicide but both the diary and his last novel the brothers karamazov ultimately find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as truly absurd creations in the last chapter camus outlines the legend of sisyphus who defied the gods and put death in chains so that no human needed to die when death was eventually liberated and it came time for sisyphus himself to die he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld finally captured the gods decided on his punishment for all eternity he would have to push a rock up a mountain upon reaching the top the rock would roll down again leaving sisyphus to start over camus sees sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest hates death and is condemned to a meaningless task camus presents sisyphuss ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices the workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks and this fate is no less absurd but it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious camus is interested in sisyphus thoughts when marching down the mountain to start anew this is the truly tragic moment when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition he does not have hope but t here is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn acknowledging the truth will conquer it sisyphus just like the absurd man keeps pushing camus claims that when sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance with a nod to the similarly cursed greek hero oedipus camus concludes that all is well indeed that o ne must imagine sisyphus happy the essay contains an appendix titled hope and the absurd in the work of franz kafka while camus acknowledges that kafkas work represents an exquisite description of the absurd condition he maintains that kafka fails as an absurd writer because his work retains a glimmer of hope

The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,the rime of the ancient mariner relates the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage the mariner stops a man who is on the way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story the wedding guests reaction turns from bemusement to impatience and fear to fascination as the mariners story progresses as can be seen in the language style for example coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create either a sense of danger of the supernatural or of serenity depending on the mood of each of the different parts of the poem the mariners tale begins with his ship departing on its journey despite initial good fortune the ship is driven south off course by a storm and eventually reaches antarctica an albatross appears and leads them out of the antarctic but even as the albatross is praised by the ships crew the mariner shoots the bird with my cross bow i shot the albatross the crew is angry with the mariner believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the antarctic however the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist however they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship from the land of mist and snow the south wind that had initially led them from the land of ice now sends the ship into uncharted waters where it is becalmed day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink here however the sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst in anger the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it or perhaps as a sign of regret ah well a day what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung eventually the ship encounters a ghostly vessel on board are death a skeleton and the night mare life in death a deathly pale woman who are playing dice for the souls of the crew with a roll of the dice death wins the lives of the crew members and life in death the life of the mariner a prize she considers more valuable her name is a clue as to the mariners fate he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross one by one all of the crew members die but the mariner lives on seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crews corpses whose last expressions remain upon their faces eventually the mariners curse is temporarily lifted when he sees sea creatures swimming in the water despite his cursing them as slimy things earlier in the poem yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them a spring of love gushd from my heart and i blessd them unaware suddenly as he manages to pray the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated the bodies of the crew possessed by good spirits rise again and steer the ship back home where it sinks in a whirlpool leaving only the mariner behind a hermit on the mainland had seen the approaching ship and had come to meet it with a pilot and the pilots boy in a boat when they pull him from the water they think he is dead but when he opens his mouth the pilot has a fit the hermit prays and the mariner picks up the oars to row the pilots boy goes crazy and laughs thinking the mariner is the devil and says the devil knows how to row as penance for shooting the albatross the mariner driven by guilt is forced to wander the earth tell his story and teach a lesson to those he meets he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all after relating the story the mariner leaves and the wedding guest returns home and wakes the next morning a sadder and a wiser man

indian woman aouda is led to a sanctuary to be sacrificed by the process of suttee the next day by brahmins since the young woman is drugged with the smoke of opium and hemp and is obviously not going voluntarily the travellers decide to rescue her they follow the procession to the site where passepartout secretly takes the place of aoudas deceased husband on the funeral pyre on which she is to be burned the next morning during the ceremony he then rises from the pyre scaring off the priests and carries the young woman away due to this incident the two days gained earlier are lost but fogg shows no sign of regret the travellers then hasten on to catch the train at the next railway station taking aouda with them at calcutta they can finally board a steamer going to hong kong fix who has secretly been following them has fogg and passepartout arrested in calcutta however they jump bail and fix is forced to follow them to hong kong on board he shows himself to passepartout who is delighted to meet again his travelling companion from the earlier voyage in hong kong it turns out that aoudas distant relative in whose care they had been planning to leave her has moved probably to holland so they decide to take her with them to europe meanwhile still without a warrant fix sees hong kong as his last chance to arrest fogg on british soil around this time passepartout becomes convinced that fix is a spy from the reform club trying to see if fogg is really going around the world however fix confides in passepartout who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a bank robber to prevent passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel fix gets passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den in his dizziness passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to yokohama but neglects to inform fogg fogg on the next day discovers that he has missed his connection he goes in search of a vessel that will take him to yokohama he finds a pilot boat that takes him and aouda to shanghai where they catch a steamer to yokohama in yokohama they go on a search for passepartout believing that he may have arrived there on the original boat they find him in a circus trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey reunited the four board a steamer taking them across the pacific to san francisco fix promises passepartout that now having left british soil he will no longer try to delay foggs journey but rather support him in getting back to britain as fast as possible to minimize the amount of his share of the stolen money that fogg can spend in san francisco they get on a trans american train to new york encountering a number of obstacles as well as a mormon missionary along the way a massive herd of bison crossing the tracks a failing suspension bridge and most disastrously the train is attacked and overcome by sioux warriors after heroically uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages

very high price from the captain soothing him thereby and has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam the companions arrive at queenstown cobh ireland in time to reach london via dublin and liverpool before the deadline however once on british soil again fix produces a warrant and arrests fogg a short time later the misunderstanding is cleared up the actual bank robber had been caught three days earlier in edinburgh in response to this fogg in a rare moment of impulse punches fix who immediately falls to the ground however fogg has missed the train and returns to london five minutes late assured that he has lost the wager in his london house the next day he apologises to aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot financially support her aouda suddenly confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her which he gladly accepts he calls for passepartout to notify the reverend at the reverends passepartout learns that he is mistaken in the date which he takes to be sunday but which actually is saturday because the party travelled east thereby gaining a full day on their journey around the globe by crossing the international date line he did not notice this after landing in north america because the only phase of the trip that depended on vehicles departing less often than daily was the atlantic crossing and he had hired his own ship for that passepartout hurries back to fogg who immediately sets off for the reform club where he arrives just in time to win the wager fogg marries aouda and the journey around the world is complete passepartout and fogg carried only a carpet bag with only two shirts and three pairs of stockings each a mackintosh a travelling cloak and a spare pair of shoes the only

sentenced to be blinded with the assistance of a kind friend gulliver escapes to blefuscu where he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship which safely

gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by some sailors who return him to england this book compares the truly moral man to the representative man the latter is clearly shown to be the

yahoos are human beings in their base form gulliver becomes a member of a horses household and comes to both admire and emulate the houyhnhnms and their lifestyle rejecting his fellow humans as merely yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices nature gave them however an assembly of the houyhnhnms rules that gulliver a yahoo with some semblance of reason is a danger to their civilization and expels him he is then rescued against his will by a portuguese ship and is surprised to see that captain pedro de mendez a yahoo is a wise courteous and generous person he returns to his home in england but he is unable to reconcile himself to living among yahoos and becomes a recluse remaining in his house largely avoiding his family

A Midsummer Night's Dream,William Shakespeare,the play features three interlocking plots connected by a celebration of the wedding of duke theseus of athens and the amazon queen hippolyta which is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of fairyland under the light of the moon in the opening scene hermia refuses to follow her fathers egeus instructions to marry demetrius whom he has chosen for her in response egeus quotes before theseus an ancient athenian law whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father or else face death theseus offers her another choice lifelong chastity while worshiping the goddess diana as a nun at that same time peter quince and his fellow players gather to produce a stage play the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe for the duke and the duchess quince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players nick bottom who is playing the main role of pyramus is over enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of thisbe the lion and pyramus at the same time he would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of ercles quince ends the meeting with at the dukes oak we meet meanwhile oberon king of the fairies and his queen titania have come to the forest outside athens titania tells oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended theseus and hippolytas wedding oberon and titania are estranged because titania refuses to give her indian changeling to oberon for use as his knight or henchman since the childs mother was one of titanias worshippers oberon seeks to punish titanias disobedience so he calls for his mischievous court jester puck or robin goodfellow to help him apply a magical juice from a flower called love in idleness originally it was a white flower but when struck by cupids bow it tints the flower purple when someone applies the potion to a sleeping persons eyelids it makes the victim fall in love with the first living thing seen upon awakening he instructs puck to retrieve the flower so that he can make titania fall in love with the first thing she sees when waking up which he is sure will be an animal of the forest oberons intent is to shame titania into giving up the little indian boy he says and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb ill make her render up her page to me having seen demetrius act cruelly toward helena oberon orders puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young athenian man instead puck mistakes lysander for demetrius not having actually seen either before and administers the juice to the sleeping lysander helena coming across him wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep upon this happening lysander immediately falls in love with helena oberon sees demetrius still following hermia and is enraged when demetrius decides to go to sleep oberon sends puck to get helena while he charms demetrius eyes upon waking up he sees helena now both men are in pursuit of helena however she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her as neither loved her originally hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her and accuses helena of stealing lysander away from her the four quarrel with each other until lysander and demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel each other to prove whose love for helena is the greatest oberon orders puck to keep lysander and demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from the two men so that they are back to normal lysander continues to love hermia and demitrius realizes that he does love helena meanwhile quince and his band of six labourers rude mechanicals as they are described by puck have arranged to perform their play about pyramus and thisbe for theseus wedding and venture into the forest near titanias bower for their rehearsal bottom is spotted by puck who taking his name to be another word for a jackass transforms his head into that of a donkey when bottom returns for his next lines the other workmen run screaming in terror much to bottoms confusion since he hasnt felt a thing during the transformation determined to wait for his friends he begins to sing to himself titania is awakened by bottoms singing and immediately falls in love with him she lavishes him with attention and presumably makes love to him while she is in this state of devotion oberon takes the changeling having achieved his goals oberon releases titania orders puck to remove the donkeys head from bottom and arrange everything so that hermia lysander demetrius and helena will believe that they have been dreaming when they awaken the fairies then disappear and theseus and hippolyta arrive on the scene during an early morning hunt they wake the lovers and since demetrius does not love hermia any more theseus overrules egeuss demands and arranges a group wedding the lovers decide that the nights events must have been a dream after they all exit bottom awakes and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream past the wit of man in athens theseus hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform pyramus and thisbe given a lack of preparation the performers are so terrible playing their roles to the point where the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy and afterward everyone retires to bed afterward oberon titania puck and other fairies enter and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune after all other characters leave puck restores amends and suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing but a dream hence the name of the play
